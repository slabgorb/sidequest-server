# CLAUDE.md — SideQuest Server (Python)

Python FastAPI game engine for SideQuest. Live backend on port 8765. Ported from
the Rust prototype `sidequest-api` per ADR-082 (2026-04-19).

## CRITICAL: Personal Project

This is a personal project under the `slabgorb` GitHub account.
- **No Jira integration.** Never create, reference, or interact with Jira tickets.
- **No 1898 org.** Nothing goes to the work GitHub org. Ever.
- All repos live under `github.com/slabgorb/`.

## SideQuest System Overview

Four repos compose the SideQuest stack:
- **sidequest-server** *(this repo)* — Python/FastAPI game engine and WebSocket API on port 8765
- **sidequest-ui** — React/TypeScript game client (Vite, port 5173)
- **sidequest-daemon** — Python media services (Z-Image image gen, ACE-Step music)
- **sidequest-content** — Genre packs (YAML configs, audio, images, world data)

Orchestrator repo (`orc-quest`, also cloned as `oq-1` / `oq-2`) coordinates sprint tracking, docs, ADRs, and cross-repo scripts.

## Quality Rules

- No stubs, no hacks, no "we'll fix it later" shortcuts
- No skipping tests to save time
- No half-wired features — connect the full pipeline or don't start
- If something needs 5 connections, make 5 connections. Don't ship 3 and call it done.
- **Never say "the right fix is X" and then do Y.** Do X.
- **Never downgrade to a "quick fix" because you think the context is "just a playtest."**
  Every playtest is production tomorrow. Fix it right.

## Development Principles

### No Silent Fallbacks
If something isn't where it should be, fail loudly. Never silently try an alternative
path, config, or default. Silent fallbacks mask configuration problems and lead to
hours of debugging "why isn't this quite right."

### No Stubbing
Don't create stub implementations, placeholder modules, or skeleton code. If a feature
isn't being implemented now, don't leave empty shells for it. Dead code is worse than
no code.

### Don't Reinvent — Wire Up What Exists
Before building anything new, check if the infrastructure already exists in the codebase.
Many systems are fully implemented but not wired into the server or UI. The fix is
integration, not reimplementation.

### Verify Wiring, Not Just Existence
When checking that something works, verify it's actually connected end-to-end. Tests
passing and files existing means nothing if the component isn't imported, the hook isn't
called, or the endpoint isn't hit in production code. Check that new code has non-test
consumers.

### Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test
Unit tests prove a component works in isolation. That's not enough. Every set of tests
must include at least one integration test that verifies the component is wired into the
system — imported, called, and reachable from production code paths.

### Backend Language
This server is Python/FastAPI per ADR-082, ported from a Rust prototype in 2026-04.
The Rust codebase is preserved read-only at <https://github.com/slabgorb/sidequest-api>
for historical reference; older ADRs that show Rust code are historical illustration
only — see `orc-quest/docs/adr/README.md` for the translation table. New backend code
goes in Python. Media services (`sidequest-daemon`) remain Python for inference
library maturity (Z-Image / ACE-Step). Claude calls go through Python subprocesses
to the Claude CLI per ADR-001. TTS was removed from the system in 2026-04.

## OTEL Observability Principle

Every backend fix that touches a subsystem MUST add OTEL watcher events so the GM panel
can verify the fix is working. Claude is excellent at "winging it" — writing convincing
narration with zero mechanical backing. The only way to catch this is OTEL logging on
every subsystem decision:

- **Intent classification** — what was the action classified as, and why?
- **Agent routing** — which agent handled the action?
- **State patches** — what changed in game state (HP, location, inventory)?
- **Inventory mutations** — items added/removed, with source
- **NPC registry** — NPCs detected, names assigned, collisions prevented
- **Trope engine** — tick results, keyword matches, activations
- **Encounter engine** — beat selections, metric changes, resolution
- **Magic / class abilities** — when a power activates, with cost and effect

The GM panel is the lie detector. If a subsystem isn't emitting OTEL spans, you can't
tell whether it's engaged or whether Claude is just improvising.

**Not needed for:** Cosmetic changes (label rewording, log message tweaks).

## Build Commands

```bash
uv sync                            # Install deps
uv run pytest -v                   # Tests
uv run ruff check .                # Lint
uv run ruff format .               # Format
uv run pyright                     # Type check
```

From the orchestrator root: `just server`, `just server-test`, `just server-check`, `just server-fmt`.

## Architecture

The package layout mirrors the prior Rust crate layout 1:1 (load-bearing per ADR-082):

```
sidequest/
├── protocol/         # GameMessage discriminated union, typed payloads
├── server/           # FastAPI app, WebSocket, dispatch, sessions, watcher
├── handlers/         # Per-message-type dispatch handlers
├── agents/           # claude -p subprocess (unified narrator + auxiliaries)
├── game/             # ~70 modules — state, combat, chase, NPCs, OCEAN, lore, etc.
├── genre/            # YAML loader, layered genre/world pack models
├── audio/            # Music + SFX coordination
├── media/            # Image generation orchestration
├── magic/            # Magic system mechanics
├── interior/         # Room / interior state
├── orbital/          # Orbital / space-scene mechanics
├── corpus/           # Conlang corpus + Markov naming
├── renderer/         # Render scheduling + throttle
├── daemon_client/    # Unix-socket client for the media daemon
├── telemetry/        # OTEL span definitions and watcher hooks
└── cli/              # encountergen, loadoutgen, namegen, validate, corpus*
```

**Dependency graph:**
