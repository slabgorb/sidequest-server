"""Per-connection WebSocket session handler.

Extracted from ``session_handler.py``: the ``WebSocketSessionHandler`` class
lives here so the lifecycle/dispatch surface can evolve without churning the
helpers (``_State``, ``_SessionData``, ``_KIND_TO_MESSAGE_CLS``, etc.) that
remain re-exported from ``session_handler``. Tracer name is preserved
(``sidequest.server.session_handler``) so OTEL consumers do not see a
span-source rename.

    Called from the ``is_first_commit`` branch of
    :meth:`WebSocketSessionHandler._handle_character_creation` after
    authored NPCs have been pre-loaded but before persistence and the
    first narrator turn fires. Picks one Opening from the world's bank
    via :func:`_resolve_opening_post_chargen`, builds a directive via
    :func:`build_directive`, and stashes both the seed and directive on
    ``session_data`` so :meth:`_run_opening_turn_narration` can consume
    them on the very next call.

    Side effects:
    - sets ``session_data.opening_seed`` to the chosen Opening's
      first_turn_invitation
    - sets ``session_data.opening_directive`` to the rendered directive
    - sets ``session_data._resolved_opening_id`` for the played-span

    No-ops gracefully when:
    - ``opening_directive`` is already populated (idempotency for
      double-confirmation guards)
    - the snapshot has no characters (defensive — chargen should have
      appended one already)
    - the world has no openings authored (Validator 7 should have
      caught this at world load)
    - resolution fails (Validators 7+8 should make this unreachable)

    The MP-joiner case is handled by the *caller*: this helper is only
    invoked from the ``is_first_commit`` branch, so a peer joining a
    snapshot that already has characters never reaches this code path.

    Playtest 2026-05-03: in MP, the canned ``mp_galley_jumprest`` opening

    when only 1 PC is seated. Resolution fails → no directive → narrator
    improvises Vaskov Centrum customs instead of the Kestrel galley. The
    second committer hits ``mp_joiner_opening_suppressed_at_consume``
    and gets joiner-orientation anchored on the (improvised) host
    location — the canned MP opening is never used.

    Fix: the populator is now called on every commit (idempotent — bails
    if directive already set). This gate decides whether to *fire* the
    opening narration based on whether the party is complete enough
    that the canned opening can resolve. Solo paths fire on first
    commit (preserves prior behavior). MP first committers DEFER until
    the last committer can re-run the populator with the full party
    seated.

    Returns ``True`` when:
      - There is no MP room (solo headless path).
      - Room reports ``non_abandoned_player_count <= 1`` (solo via room).
      - The directive is already populated (resolver succeeded —

        managed to set the directive (e.g. world has no openings — the

        The builder encodes accumulated archetype hints as
        ``f"{jungian}/{rpg_role}"`` on ``character.resolved_archetype`` (see
        ``builder.py:1585-1590``). This helper detects that raw form, runs
        the four-tier resolve (base → constraints → world funnels), and
        replaces the raw pair with the resolved display name via
        ``apply_archetype_resolved`` — keeping ``archetype_provenance`` in
        lockstep.

        Resolution failures emit a ``character_creation.archetype_resolution_failed``
        span event and leave the raw pair in place. The downstream
        archetype-resolution gate in ``_chargen_confirmation`` (Story
        45-6, ``_gate_archetype_resolution``) detects the partial state
        and rejects the commit with a typed ERROR frame
        (``code="chargen_archetype_unresolved"``); this helper is
        no-op-on-failure intentionally so the gate can decide. Missing
        axis data on the pack (no ``base_archetypes`` or
        ``archetype_constraints``) also silently no-ops here — the
        gate then routes to ``OK_NO_AXES`` (pass) if the builder
        produced no pair, or ``raw_pair_unresolved`` (block) if the
        builder produced a pair the resolver couldn't run.

        character: Character,

    ) -> tuple[bool, str | None]:
        """Inspect the post-resolve character state and decide whether
        chargen is allowed to ship.

        The gate distinguishes three states:

        - **OK_RESOLVED** — ``apply_archetype_resolved`` ran and stamped
          ``archetype_provenance``. The discriminator keys on
          ``character.archetype_provenance is not None``, NOT on the
          shape of ``resolved_archetype`` — that survives display
          names that legitimately contain ``"/"``. Pass.
        - **OK_NO_AXES** — ``resolved_archetype is None`` AND the pack
          opted out of the archetype system
          (``base_archetypes is None and archetype_constraints is None``).
          The builder didn't form a pair and the resolver had nothing
          to resolve. Pass.
        - **BLOCKED_PARTIAL** — anything else. Three failure modes
          (Story 45-6 / playtest 3 ``pumblestone`` corpus):

          1. ``raw_pair_unresolved`` — a literal ``"jungian/rpg_role"``
             string is still on the character AND the pack lacks axes.
             ``_resolve_character_archetype`` short-circuited at the
             pack-axes check (line 579) before calling
             ``resolve_archetype``; the raw pair stayed.
          2. ``missing_axes_with_pack_axes`` — pack declares axes but
             the chargen scenes accumulated at most one hint, so the
             builder set ``resolved_archetype = None``. This is the
             ``pumblestone`` failure: chargen scenes malformed.
          3. ``resolver_raised`` — pack has axes AND a raw pair is
             still on the character. Pure shape inference: the
             pack-lacks-axes short-circuit at line 579 would have
             returned before calling ``resolve_archetype``, so a raw
             pair with pack-axes-set can only mean the resolver was
             called and raised — the catch-block at line 595 caught
             ``GenreValidationError`` and returned, leaving the raw
             pair.

        The evaluator span fires on every chargen-confirm; the blocked
        span fires only on BLOCKED_PARTIAL. Both go to the GM panel via
        ``SPAN_ROUTES`` (Sebastien's lie-detector — CLAUDE.md OTEL
        Observability Principle). On the blocked branch a
        ``logger.warning()`` entry is also emitted to the structured
        server log so ops debugging is independent of the OTEL pipeline
        (python.md rule 4).

        Returns ``(is_blocked, block_reason)`` — ``block_reason`` is
        one of ``"raw_pair_unresolved"``,
        ``"missing_axes_with_pack_axes"``, ``"resolver_raised"``, or
        ``None`` on a pass.

                    # 2026-04-30 caught both halves of the broadcast bug:
                    #   (1) commit 4b90250 — peers missed all four because
                    #       they were only appended to ``outbound`` (which
                    #       ships to the dispatcher socket alone). Fix added
                    #       a peer-broadcast helper.
                    #   (2) follow-on bug — the dispatcher's *own* socket
                    #       missed the four envelopes whenever the dispatcher
                    #       reconnected mid-narration (browser refresh during
                    #       the 30-60s Claude await). The peer-broadcast
                    #       excluded the dispatcher's pre-await socket_id;

                    #       writer task on the old socket; the new socket
                    #       got nothing because the envelopes aren't in
                    #       EventLog to replay. Last-submitter froze every
