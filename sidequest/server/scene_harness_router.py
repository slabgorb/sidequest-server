"""Dev-gated ``POST /dev/scene/{name}`` route (ADR-092).

Registered into the FastAPI app only when ``DEV_SCENES=1`` is set when
``create_app()`` runs. Production builds carry zero scene-harness
surface — the router is not even constructed.

Wires together the existing pieces:

* :func:`sidequest.game.scene_harness.hydrate_fixture` — YAML → GameSnapshot
* :func:`sidequest.game.game_slug.generate_slug` — mints a fresh slug
* :class:`sidequest.game.persistence.SqliteStore` — persists the snapshot
* :func:`sidequest.game.persistence.upsert_game` — registers the games row
* :func:`sidequest.telemetry.watcher_hub.publish_event` — emits OTEL spans
  for the GM panel (CLAUDE.md OTEL Observability Principle)

Span vocabulary (asserted by ``tests/server/test_scene_harness.py``):

* ``scene_harness.intent.load`` — fixture name + slug, fires before hydration
* ``scene_harness.hydrate.ok`` — field counts (npcs, characters) on success
* ``scene_harness.hydrate.error`` — fixture name + error class on failure
* ``scene_harness.persist.ok`` — slug + save path after commit
