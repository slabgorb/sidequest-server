"""Confirmation-phase summary rendering for the character builder.

Port of ``sidequest-server/src/dispatch/chargen_summary.rs``.

Until 2026-04-09 this lived inside ``CharacterBuilder.to_scene_message`` in
the ``sidequest.game`` package (and the equivalent in the Rust source). That
was the wrong home: the builder is a state machine, and a faithful
confirmation summary needs inputs the builder does not own — specifically
the **lobby-provided player name** (there is no chargen scene for it in
genres like ``caverns_and_claudes``) and the **genre pack's
``starting_equipment`` table** (resolved from ``inventory.yaml``, not from
scene effects).

Keeping summary rendering inside the builder silently dropped those two
fields during the Thessa playtest bug on 2026-04-09. Moving it here
co-locates rendering with the data it requires: the server-side dispatch
layer already holds the ``GenrePack`` and the lobby name at every chargen
call site.

The builder stays responsible for the state machine; this module is the
view. New summary fields go here, not in the builder.
