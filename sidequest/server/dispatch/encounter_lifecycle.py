    the narrator can re-classify them on a later turn via an explicit

    both PCs' actions concatenated, but the trigger only carries one
    ``player_name`` — the action submitter for the barrier-firing frame. The
    other PCs in the bundle never reached the actor roster, so the client
    widget rendered only one PC even though both played the round. Pass
    ``additional_player_names`` (typically every other PC in
    ``snapshot.player_seats.values()`` minus ``player_name``) to seat them as
    side="player" actors. Solo callers and tests can leave it as ``None`` for
    back-compat. Sealed-letter (commit-reveal duel) encounters keep the
    strict 1-PC red / 1-NPC blue pairing — the resolver looks up actors by
    role tag and a third PC there would break role lookup.

    in story 45-52). The fallback is only consulted when the explicit list
    is empty — an explicit ``npcs_present`` is always authoritative.

    Note: ``GenrePack`` has no ``.slug`` attribute; ``genre_slug`` must be
