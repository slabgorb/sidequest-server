    Called after every beat that advances ``player_metric`` (the dial
    that tracks "opponents being defeated"). The function checks which
    triggers apply (per B/X morale rules), deduplicates via
    ``encounter.morale_events``, calls ``maybe_check_morale`` for each
    eligible trigger, and records the result.

    ─── Dial-based pseudo-HP approximation (V1 deviation) ───────────────
    The encounter engine uses dial abstractions (``player_metric``,
    ``opponent_metric``) rather than per-opponent HP. The morale spec
    (§4.4) describes triggers in terms of "opponent count drops by 1",
    which has no direct analog in this system. V1 approximates:

        pseudo_initial    = player_metric.threshold
        pseudo_pre_alive  = max(0, threshold - pre_dial_value)
        pseudo_post_alive = max(0, threshold - post_dial_value)

    Higher dial value = "more opponents down". This preserves the
    invariants the spec needs (first_blood on first dial advance,
    half_killed when post crosses ⌊threshold/2⌋), but is lossy — no
    per-opponent KO event, no per-opponent leader tag.

    ─── V1 limitations ──────────────────────────────────────────────────
    - ``leader_killed`` is False at the per-beat path. The dial-based
      wire cannot detect *which* actor was KO'd; that requires
      per-opponent HP tracking (future story). The narrator-emitted
      ``intimidated`` sidecar (Task 10) is the working path for explicit
      leader-takedown signaling until then.
    - ``mindless`` is global per side at this resolution (see
      ``_all_opponents_mindless`` — V1 returns False).

    ─── Use direct-call path for tests ──────────────────────────────────
    Tests that want to exercise per-opponent semantics (specifically the
    "two goblins, kill one then kill the other" scenario, or the
    ``leader_killed`` trigger) call this helper directly with
    constructed ``OpponentState`` lists. The helper itself is correct
    per spec; only the production wire is approximate.

    Returns a list of ``(trigger, outcome)`` tuples for the caller to
    act on (chase escalation / surrender / rout). Deferred to Task 12
    for full flee-consequence dispatch; this task wires detection +
    recording.

    OTEL: morale-check spans are deferred to Task 12 (per plan). This
    function emits a watcher event per trigger for GM-panel visibility

    Drop every beat selection whose actor is a *seated PC*. Those

    originate from a ``DICE_THROW`` frame on a player's socket, so they
    fail the explicit-consent contract. NPC beats (opponents, neutrals,
    AND companion NPCs on the player side) are passed through unchanged:
    only seated PCs need the consent contract.

    ``seated_pc_names`` is the set of actor names that map to a seat in
    ``snapshot.player_seats.values()``. When passed, only those names
    trigger the rejection — narrator-driven NPC ally beats (Donut's
    ``defend target='Carl'``, etc.) flow through the gate so downstream
    resolvers can apply them with the same OTEL discipline as opponent
    beats. When omitted (legacy callers / pre-MP saves), the gate falls
    back to the original side-only check (every player-side actor is
    treated as seated).

    Donut's ``defend target='Carl'`` was being rejected with

    NPC — the gate had no way to distinguish him from Carl. After the
    seat-aware fix, companion-NPCs reach the resolver and emit
    ``apply_beat`` + ``encounter.beat_applied`` watcher events; Carl's
    explicit-consent contract still applies for Carl himself.

    Each rejected PC beat emits a span + watcher event so the GM panel
    can see the gate firing. Without OTEL the gate is invisible — and
    "is this fix actually working?" is unanswerable.

    ``narrating_player`` is the player whose narration produced these

    ``dice_failed=True`` / ``False`` signals a dice-replay turn — the dice
    is the mechanical event for the rolling player. ``None`` means no dice
    this turn (free-text turn; narrator's beat_selections stand on their
    declared tier).

    ``dice_actor`` is the rolling actor's name (paired with ``dice_failed``).
    On a dice-replay turn, only that actor's beat selection is filtered out —
    ``dispatch_dice_throw`` already applied it. Other actors' selections
    (typically opponent-side NPCs the narrator routes the round-trip through)
    still apply so the opponent dial can advance and combat is two-sided.
    Playtest 2026-04-25 [P0]: prior behavior dropped *all* selections,
    leaving the opponent dial inert and combat structurally unresolvable.

    ``from_explicit_action`` is False on the production session-handler
    path (the only real call site routes narrator-extracted prose). The
    SOUL-gate (Playtest 2026-04-26 [S2-BUG]) drops every PC-side beat
    selection in that mode and emits ``confrontation
    .inferred_pc_beat_rejected`` watcher events — PC mechanical actions
    MUST trace back to an explicit DICE_THROW frame, never to a peer or
    self narration. Test helpers that simulate the dispatch path may set
    ``from_explicit_action=True`` to bypass the gate.

    Playtest 2026-05-06 wiring fix. The narrator describes hiring NPCs in
    prose ("Donut takes the contract") and now ALSO emits
    ``companions_added`` / ``companions_dismissed`` in its game_patch
    sidecar. This seam mutates ``snapshot.companions`` and emits one
    ``party.recruit`` / ``party.dismiss`` watcher span per change so
    Sebastien's GM panel sees the mechanical event paired with the prose.

    Add semantics: append a fresh ``Companion`` for each unique name not
    already on the roster. Re-hiring an already-on-roster name is a
    silent no-op (the narrator may re-mention the contract without
    intending a duplicate). Dismissal removes the first matching name
    (case-insensitive); unmatched names log + emit a ``party.dismiss``
    span with ``status=unmatched`` so the GM panel can see the prose
    referenced a companion that wasn't on the roster.

       opponent has named the source of the threat as their target.
    2. **Shield the attacker's target.** Defender's beat is ``brace``

       This is the "companion-NPC ally shields the patron" case —
       Donut's ``defend target='Carl'`` while Sumpdrake's ``attack
       target='Carl'``. The narrator's prose puts Donut between the
       drake and Carl; the engine must read that intent from the
       ``target`` field rather than treating it as self-defense.

    Both forms produce the same mechanical effect: the attacker's tier
    downgrades by one step (CritSuccess → Success, Success → Tie).
    Failed offenses don't get worse from a successful defense.

    A brace with ``target=<self>`` (defender shielding themselves
    while the attacker is hitting someone else) is NOT a counteract —
    self-defense doesn't intercept attacks on third parties. A brace
    with no ``target`` field is also not a counteract; the narrator
    must name an actor explicitly so the GM panel can audit the gate

    # tier-applied-to-both-sides logic produced two structurally wrong
    # behaviors:
    #
    # 1. A player CritSuccess (shift +13) handed the OPPONENT CritSuccess
    #    too — sumpdrake's strike dial advanced +base on every Carl crit.
    # 2. A player Success against an opponent rolling normally (shift in
    #    [-1, +1]) collapsed to Tie tier, and a Success against an
    #    opponent rolling well (shift ≤ -2) collapsed to Fail. So plain
    #    Successes never moved the player dial — only nat20s did.
    #
    # Keith's rule (canonical): "a plain Success outcome on a beat MUST
    # shift momentum unless the opponent's parallel beat *successfully

    #   matches the attacker's actor name AND the defender's own tier is
    #   Success or CritSuccess.
    # - On counteract the attacker's tier downgrades by one step
    #   (CritSuccess → Success, Success → Tie). Tie/Fail/CritFail are
    #   unchanged (no further downgrade — failed offenses stay failed).
