"""Per-session magic-state initialization.

Phase 4 cut-point requires that, at chargen confirmation, a Coyote-Star
session lands with ``snapshot.magic_state`` populated and the freshly
built character already added to the ledger so per-character bars
(sanity / notice / vitality) can mutate from the very first turn.

This module owns the wire path:

    genre pack source_dir + world_slug + character.core.name
        ↓
    load_world_magic(genre_yaml, world_yaml)  →  WorldMagicConfig
        ↓
    MagicState.from_config(config) + add_character(character_id)
        ↓
    snapshot.magic_state

The function fails closed: any LoaderError is logged loud (CLAUDE.md
"No Silent Fallbacks") and ``snapshot.magic_state`` is left at its
prior value (typically ``None``). It does NOT raise — chargen has
already produced a character, and refusing to confirm because magic
config is malformed would orphan the commit.

Worlds without a ``magic.yaml`` (the common case for genres that don't
model magic) skip silently — the absence of the file is a deliberate
authoring decision, not a config error.
