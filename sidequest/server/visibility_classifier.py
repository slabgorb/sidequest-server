"""Narration visibility classifier (Story 49-8).

Produces the ``_visibility`` sidecar dict that drives per-recipient
narration routing in :mod:`sidequest.server.emitters`. The classifier
runs at the post-narration emit site after the narrator subprocess has
returned — no extra LLM calls.

Found in the 2026-05-12 caverns_sunden playtest: the live
``WebSocketSessionHandler`` ships ``visibility_sidecar=None`` so every
player receives every per-PC narration card identically in third
person. This module fills the gap with the v2 sidecar shape:

    {
        "visible_to": "all" | [player_id, ...],
        "fidelity":   {entity_id: fidelity_level},
        "anchor_pc":  "Carl" | None,
        "pov_strategy": "pc_anchored" | "atmospheric" | "private",
        # ADR-105 B2 — present ONLY when the turn carried redacted
        # routes; absent for solo/atmospheric (byte-unchanged):
        "private_segments": [
            {"visible_to": [player_id, ...] | "all",
             "fidelity": {...}, "subsystem": str, "idempotency_key": str},
            ...
        ],
    }

The v2 keys (``anchor_pc``, ``pov_strategy``) and the ADR-105 B2
``private_segments`` key are purely additive to the v1 shape; existing
consumers (:class:`sidequest.game.projection.rules.VisibilityTagRule`,
:func:`sidequest.server.session_helpers.aggregate_visibility`,
:func:`sidequest.server.emitters._apply_pov_swap`) ignore keys they do
not know about. ``private_segments`` is the structured private-route
map B3 partitions prose into and B4 POV-swaps per recipient.

Anchor inference order:
  1. ``result.action_rewrite.named`` — the structured field the
     narrator emits per ADR-039. Validated against the snapshot's PC
     roster; NPC names are NOT accepted as anchors.
  2. First-sentence scan of ``result.narration`` for a PC name from the
     roster.
  3. No match → atmospheric (``anchor_pc=None``,
     ``pov_strategy="atmospheric"``).
