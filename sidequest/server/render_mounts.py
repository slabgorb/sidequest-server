"""Self-healing render-asset mount registry.

The daemon writes generated images to a tmpdir whose path changes on every
daemon restart (``/var/folders/.../sq-daemon-XXXX/zimage/``). The server
exposes those files via a ``/renders/*`` static-file mount. If the daemon
restarts mid-session, the server's mount stays pinned to the *old* tmpdir
and every new render 404s — that's the playtest 2026-04-25 [S4-BUG]
regression.

This module implements the architect-approved Option-2 fix:

* On every render-completed message, before building the URL we hand to
  the UI, call :func:`ensure_render_mount` with the absolute filesystem
  path the daemon returned.
* The registry computes the daemon root that contains the file, and if
  that root isn't already served, appends it to the live ``StaticFiles``
  app's directory list (``all_directories``). Starlette's
  ``lookup_path`` walks that list at request time, so newly-appended
  roots are picked up without restart.
* The URL builder (``url_for_path``) translates the absolute path into a
  ``/renders/<rel-to-root>`` URL using the *matching* root — which may
  differ from ``SIDEQUEST_OUTPUT_DIR`` after a daemon restart.

Invariants:

* Idempotent: registering the same root twice is a no-op.
* Old roots are never unmounted — in-flight URLs stay valid until the
  underlying tmpdir is reaped by the OS.
* If a path can't be matched to any known root we emit
  ``image_unavailable`` (forensics, CLAUDE.md OTEL principle).
* If a new root has to be registered post-handshake, we emit
  ``render_assets.mount_remounted`` so the GM panel sees the
  self-healing event. That's the lie detector for "did the fix actually
  fire when the daemon restarted?"
