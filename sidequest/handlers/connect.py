    Pre-fix (playtest 2026-04-30 #9), saves created before
    ``init_magic_state_for_session`` was wired into chargen — or via any
    code path that skipped the chargen branch — landed on resume with
    ``snapshot.magic_state = None``. The ``magic_working`` pipeline then
    silently no-op'd: server-side validation ran but had no
    character-keyed bars to debit, so threshold-promotion → status
    updates never landed and the LedgerPanel never surfaced bars. The
    failure was perfectly silent — exactly the kind of half-wired feature
    CLAUDE.md "Verify Wiring, Not Just Existence" forbids.

    The helper is a no-op when:
      - the world has no ``magic.yaml`` pair (correct: non-magic worlds
        keep ``magic_state=None``);
      - ``snapshot.magic_state`` is already populated (resume from a
        post-init save);
      - the snapshot has no ``characters`` to key the ledger by;
      - ``init_magic_state_for_session`` returns ``False`` (loader
        error — already logged loud at ERROR by the helper).

    Emits a ``magic_state.backfilled_on_resume`` OTEL span on success so
    the GM panel can spot when a backfill actually fired (per CLAUDE.md
    OTEL Observability Principle: subsystem fixes must be GM-panel-
