class YieldHandler:
    """Handle a YIELD message — player withdraws from the active encounter.

    Marks the actor withdrawn; resolves the encounter when every
    player-side actor has yielded or been taken out; refunds edge.

    Playtest 2026-04-30 fix: pre-fix, this handler returned ``[]`` on
    success — `handle_yield` mutated the snapshot but emitted no
    outbound message, so the UI showed stale state and the player
    perceived a silent no-op. The watcher-hub events from
    `dispatch/yield_action.py` (`yield_received`, `yield_resolved`,
    `resolved`) publish to the GM dashboard but NOT to the player's
    own socket and NOT to the standard logger, so `grep yield
    /tmp/sidequest-server.log` returned nothing for the entire
    session — the canonical "no observable effect" failure mode.

    Post-fix:

    1. Log INFO at handler entry/exit so the session log carries a
       grep-able yield trail.
    2. Emit a fresh CONFRONTATION message to the player so the UI
       reflects ``actor.withdrawn=True`` and ``encounter.active=False``
       immediately. When the encounter is fully resolved (every
       player-side actor withdrawn) the payload is built with
       ``active=False`` so the overlay unmounts.

    Narration of the yielded outcome still flows through
    ``pending_resolution_signal`` on the next narrator turn — that's
    the existing spec contract (2026-04-25-dual-track-momentum-design.md
    §Yield action). The player gets immediate UI feedback here; the
    narrator gets the final word on the next exchange.
