    The UI drives all rolls via confrontation beat selection: it builds
    the DiceRequest locally, auto-rolls in Rapier, and sends a single
    DICE_THROW carrying the beat_id + physics-settled faces. The server
    applies the beat, resolves the dice, broadcasts DiceRequest +
    DiceResult to the room, and then runs the narrator inline so the
    rolling player sees prose in the same round-trip.

    Returns [] — all outbound messages go through the room broadcast
    queue so every connected socket (rolling player included) sees the
    same event stream.
