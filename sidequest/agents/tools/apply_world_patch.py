"""Tool: apply_world_patch — narrator escape hatch for world-state mutations.

Phase C Task 27 — WRITE tool. ADR-011 escape hatch.

What this tool is for
---------------------
This is the **last-resort escape hatch** that lets the narrator mutate
world state when no typed tool covers the mutation. Per ADR-011, every
narrator-declared state change should ideally route through a typed,
domain-aware tool (``apply_damage``, ``advance_scene_clue``,
``update_resource_pool``, ...) so that the GM panel sees a structured
record. The escape hatch exists because the Phase C surface is not yet
complete — some narrator intents have no typed home — and because
genre-specific worlds will always grow new state fields faster than
typed tools.

Deprecation criterion
---------------------
Per ADR-011 the deprecation target is **zero ``apply_world_patch`` spans
across 10 consecutive playtests**. Hitting that threshold means every
mutation the narrator wants to make has a typed home. To make that
threshold measurable, **every invocation is heavily OTEL-instrumented**,
including rejections (unsupported paths, type mismatches). The GM panel
counts spans, not successes — a rejected escape-hatch attempt is just
as much a signal as a successful one that the typed surface has a gap.

v1 scope (deliberately narrow)
------------------------------
The narrator's JSON-pointer ``path`` argument is the conceptual
interface; the implementation maps a small allowlist of top-level paths
onto :class:`sidequest.game.session.WorldStatePatch` fields and calls
:meth:`GameSnapshot.apply_world_patch`. Anything outside the allowlist
is a **recoverable error** (the narrator can pick a typed tool instead).

Supported paths (v1):

- ``/location`` → ``WorldStatePatch.location`` (str)
- ``/time_of_day`` → ``WorldStatePatch.time_of_day`` (str)
- ``/atmosphere`` → ``WorldStatePatch.atmosphere`` (str)
- ``/current_region`` → ``WorldStatePatch.current_region`` (str)
- ``/active_stakes`` → ``WorldStatePatch.active_stakes`` (str)

These are the five string-valued top-level world fields that have no
dedicated typed tool yet. Other ``WorldStatePatch`` fields — ``hp_changes``
(use ``apply_damage``), ``npc_attitudes`` (use ``update_npc_disposition``),
``quest_log``/``quest_updates``, ``discovered_regions``, ``npcs_present``,
``lore_established``, ``discovered_facts`` — are intentionally **not**
exposed through the escape hatch because they have, or will have, typed
homes; routing them here would defeat the deprecation telemetry.

Path support widens only when a real narrator playtest demonstrates a
mutation that has no typed home and no path-allowlist entry. Until
then, every "I need to set X" the narrator surfaces is a vote either
for adding X to the allowlist or for building a typed tool for X.

Why "recoverable" for unsupported paths
---------------------------------------
A rejection isn't fatal — the narrator can adjust its plan and call a
typed tool on the next turn. Fatal would force the orchestrator to abort
the whole turn, which is the wrong shape for "this escape hatch can't
serve this mutation".
