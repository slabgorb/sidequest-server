"""Tool: query_character — fetch a character sheet, perception-coarsened by view.

Phase C Task 6 — first per-tool perception rule
-----------------------------------------------
Replaces ad-hoc PC-sheet blocks in the narrator prompt with an on-demand
tool call. The handler returns the FULL sheet (filtered by ``include``);
the perception layer (``NarratorPerceptionFilter._rule_query_character``,
registered in ``sidequest/agents/narrator_perception_filter.py``)
coarsens for non-self views before the SDK ever sees the bytes.

Plan deviations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1. **``"resources"`` dropped from include.** The plan listed
   ``Literal["stats","inventory","status","backstory","resources"]``.
   Resources are session-scoped pools (ADR-033), not per-character —
   ``update_resource_pool`` (Task 5) owns that shape. Forwarding
   ``"resources"`` here would propagate scope confusion to the narrator.
   Final literal: ``["stats","inventory","status","backstory"]``.
2. **OTEL coarsened-flag is set by the handler, not the rule.** The
   rule runs inside the dispatch span (see ``Registry.dispatch``), but
   the handler knows ``ctx.perspective_pc`` directly and writes the
   ``tool.character.perception_coarsened`` attribute before returning,
   so the GM panel sees the value regardless of how the rule chain
   evolves.

Party model (v1)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
"Party" = ``snapshot.characters``. The session-local PC list IS the
party for our purposes. ADR-037 multiplayer per-player state will be
revisited in a later phase; v1 doesn't need an ``is_in_party`` flag.
NPCs are out of scope here — they belong to ``query_npc`` (Task 7).

Perception coarsening (rule, NOT this handler)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* ``perspective_pc is None`` or ``perspective_pc == character_id``:
  exact sheet, ``include``-filtered.
* ``perspective_pc != character_id`` (other party member): identity
  fields kept; ``stats``/``inventory``/``backstory`` dropped; ``status``
  kept (visibly applied effects are public-knowledge); ``edge_*`` keys
  dropped in favour of ``edge_band`` (unwounded / wounded / bloodied /
  staggering / down). See ADR-078 for the edge-band severity model.

Legacy
~~~~~~
Replaces the per-turn PC blocks in narrator prompt assembly and the
PerceptionRewriter post-hoc string scrub (ADR-028). The narrator now
asks for exactly what it needs and the perception layer is enforced at
the tool boundary, not via regex on rendered text.
