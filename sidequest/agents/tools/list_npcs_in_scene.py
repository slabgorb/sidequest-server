"""Tool: list_npcs_in_scene — id-only roster filtered by scene.

Phase C Task 8 — read tool, no perception rule (yet)
----------------------------------------------------
Returns the NPCs present in a scene as ``{npc_id, name}`` pairs only.
Callers fetch details via ``query_npc``. This keeps the per-call payload
small and routes any per-PC coarsening through ``query_npc``'s rule.

v1 simplifications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* **No formal scene_id.** ``GameSnapshot`` has no ``current_scene``
  field; NPCs carry ``location`` (world-scoped string) and
  ``current_room`` (chassis interior). v1 treats ``scene_id`` as a
  string that matches either of those — the narrator already uses both
  fields fluidly in prose. A future story may introduce a typed Scene
  with id resolution; until then this matcher covers the live cases.
* **scene_id fallback.** When ``scene_id is None``, the handler looks
  up the perspective PC in ``snapshot.characters`` (by
  ``core.name == ctx.perspective_pc``) and uses that PC's
  ``current_room``. If the PC is absent or has no room (or no
  perspective is set at all), the handler returns the FULL roster —
  this is intentional: omniscient/debug callers get everything, and a
  PC who hasn't been placed yet shouldn't see an empty scene.
* **No line-of-sight engine.** The plan's "filter to NPCs the PC can
  perceive" rule is a no-op in v1: scene-id matching is already
  perspective-respecting once the PC's room is known, and no LOS /
  audibility system exists. Rather than register a pass-through rule
  for cosmetic completeness, this tool registers no rule — the
  registry defaults to pass-through for tools without one. When LOS
  lands, add a perception rule here.

Only ``tool.npcs.count`` is set per the plan spec.
