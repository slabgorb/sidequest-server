"""Orchestrator — Phase 1 narration turn pipeline.

Port of sidequest-agents/src/orchestrator.rs (Phase 1 slice only).
ADR-082: Python server narration vertical slice.

Phase 1 covers the narration-only turn path:
  Player action (raw text)
    → build context (world state + character + genre prompts)
    → call narrator agent via ClaudeClient
    → parse narrator response (narration text + game_patch JSON block)
    → return NarrationTurnResult

Phase boundaries are marked with:
  # Phase 1 slice: <subsystem> deferred to Story 41-<N>
and raise NotImplementedError when a deferred code path would be reached
(per CLAUDE.md "No Stubbing").

Out of scope (Phase 2+):
  - Combat encounter dispatch (Phase 3)
  - Dice request handling (Phase 2)
  - Scenario progression (Phase 5)
  - Advancement / beat firing (Phase 6)
  - Media/image/audio triggers (Phase 7)
  - Intent routing beyond state-override (Phase 1 uses exploration only, per ADR-067)
  - Continuity validation, lore filtering, world-builder injection (Phase 2+)

# Task E1.5-B — SDK-path tool-owned / presentation partition.
#
# On the SDK narration path the 26 WRITE tools mutate AND persist
# (``ctx.store.save``) game state during the tool-dispatch loop. The
# narrator ALSO emits a sidecar ``game_patch`` block (the prompt still
# injects ``narrator_output_only``). Feeding that sidecar through the
# normal assembler would make ``narration_apply`` re-apply every
# tool-owned mutation a SECOND time (double-apply bug). So on the SDK
# path the tool-owned fields are ZEROED — the tools are the single
# authority for those categories — while presentation/signal fields with
# NO successor tool stay sidecar-sourced.
#
# Each entry below maps a ``NarrationTurnResult`` field to the
# ``COVERAGE_MAP`` row(s) (see tests/agents/test_sidecar_coverage_map.py)
# whose successor tool now owns + persists that state during dispatch.
# When zeroed on the SDK-path result, the corresponding
# ``narration_apply._apply_narration_result_to_snapshot`` branch (and the
# websocket_session_handler trope/affinity/clue seams) becomes a no-op,
# so the tool's dispatch-time write is the only write.
#
# game_patch_dict is zeroed too: it carries the escape-hatch sidecar
# intents (plot_course / morale_event / raw world-patch) that
# ``apply_world_patch`` (patches_other) and ``update_npc_disposition``
# (patches_disposition) now own.
#
# items_* / gold_change / quest_updates / lore_established / companions_*
# are deliberately NOT in this partition: NO registered tool in
# sidequest/agents/tools/ mutates inventory, gold, the quest log, lore, or
# the companion roster (verified — query_character/query_encounter only
# READ inventory), and none has a COVERAGE_MAP row. They stay
# sidecar-sourced so narration_apply remains their single applier on BOTH
# paths.
#
# KNOWN GAP (out of scope, follow-up): zeroing ``location`` means
# narration_apply's region canonicalization / room-graph promotion
# (narration_apply.py ~1763-1817) no longer runs for SDK turns —

        Distinct from :meth:`_assemble_turn_result` (the ClaudeClient

        its callers). On the SDK path the 26 WRITE tools already mutated AND
        persisted (``ctx.store.save``) game state during the tool-dispatch
        loop, so re-applying the narrator's sidecar would double-apply.

        The split:

        * **Presentation / no-successor-tool fields** — built by the shared
          :meth:`_presentation_and_untooled_fields` helper (scene_mood,

          action_rewrite, items_*, quest_updates, gold_change,

          STRUCTURALLY cannot emit a tool-owned key, so the SDK result
          carries only sidecar-sourced presentation/untooled state.
        * **Tool-owned state** — every field in
          :data:`_SDK_TOOL_OWNED_FIELDS` — is left at its dataclass default
          (zeroed) by simply not being added to the shared kwargs. The
          tool's dispatch-time write is the single authority;
          ``narration_apply`` (and the session-handler trope/affinity/clue
          seams) become no-ops for those categories.
        * ``tool_calls`` — the ADR-103 ledger (built once by
          :meth:`_build_tool_calls_ledger`, also emitted on the
          ``narration.turn`` span by the caller).

        The post-construction fail-loud invariant is a backstop: the
        structural guarantee (shared helper omits tool-owned keys) is the
        primary guard; the assertion catches a future edit that adds a
