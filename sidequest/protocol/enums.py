"""Protocol enums: MessageType, NarratorVerbosity, NarratorVocabulary.

Port of the enum definitions from sidequest-protocol/src/message.rs.

MessageType is a Python str enum of all wire-format type strings that
appear in the serde rename attributes on GameMessage variants. It does
not exist as a standalone Rust enum — the wire strings are encoded as
#[serde(rename = "...")] on each GameMessage variant. The Python
protocol layer makes them explicit here for use in dispatch/routing.

NarratorVerbosity and NarratorVocabulary are direct ports of the Rust
enums from message.rs.
