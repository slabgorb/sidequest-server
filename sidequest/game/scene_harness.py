"""Scene-harness fixture hydrator (ADR-092 §Implementation).

Reads a YAML fixture from ``scenarios/fixtures/{name}.yaml`` and hydrates
it into a :class:`GameSnapshot` the existing ``SqliteStore`` can persist.
The dev-gated HTTP route in :mod:`sidequest.server.scene_harness_router`
wraps this hydrator; this module owns no I/O beyond the single fixture
read.

Two distinct error types let the HTTP layer map failures to 404 vs 422:

* :exc:`FixtureNotFoundError` — the fixture file does not exist in
  ``fixtures_dir``. HTTP layer surfaces as 404.
* :exc:`FixtureValidationError` — the fixture exists but its contents
  are invalid (missing ``genre``/``world``, malformed YAML, unsafe YAML
  payload, field-level validation rejection). HTTP layer surfaces as 422.

The hydrator inherits ADR-069's YAML schema and ADR-092's "Failure is
loud" discipline: no silent defaults for required identity fields, no
``yaml.load`` on untrusted input, no path traversal out of
``fixtures_dir``.
