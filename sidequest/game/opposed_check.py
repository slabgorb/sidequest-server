"""Opposed-check resolution — both sides roll, tier from the shift.

Spec: ``.archive/handoffs/opposed-checks-design.md`` (Architect, 2026-04-26).

The legacy ``beat_selection`` resolution mode rolls only the player's d20 and
lets the narrator pick the opponent's outcome tier from prose. Combat ran
through that path: the player rolled, the opponent narrated, the dial moved
whatever direction the LLM picked. Combat felt structurally unfair because it
*was* — a Challenge resolver was doing a Conflict's job.

This module is the third branch (``ResolutionMode.opposed_check``):

1. Both sides roll d20 + ability modifier.
2. ``shift = player_roll_with_mod - opponent_roll_with_mod``.
3. Tier comes from the shift bands (calibrated per ADR-093)::

       shift >= +10  → CritSuccess
       shift >= +2   → Success
       shift in [-1, +1] → Tie
       shift <= -2   → Fail
       shift <= -10  → CritFail

4. The derived tier feeds the existing ``apply_beat()`` once for each side.

Stat sourcing (player side reuses the existing dice path; opponent side is
the new contract):

- Look in ``EncounterActor.per_actor_state["stats"]`` first (per-instance).
- Fall back to ``ConfrontationDef.opponent_default_stats[<stat_check>]``.
- Hard-fail-loud if neither carries the stat. **No silent zero defaults**
  (CLAUDE.md no-silent-fallback rule).

Modifier formula matches the dice dispatcher: ``floor((score - 10) / 2)``.

OTEL: callers MUST emit ``encounter.opposed_roll_resolved`` BEFORE applying
beats (``encounter_opposed_roll_resolved_span``). That span is the lie-
detector for "did the engine actually run an opposed check or did the
narrator backslide into picking the tier."
