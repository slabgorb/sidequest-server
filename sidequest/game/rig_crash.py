"""Rig crash handler — Composure→0 fires injury tag + Edge hit + dismount.

Story 53-3, Epic 53 (Road Warrior). The consequence layer that subscribes
to :class:`~sidequest.game.rig_composure_pool.RigComposurePool` downward
zero-crossing events. When a driver's rig wrecks, four things happen
(per ``sidequest-content/genre_packs/road_warrior/rules.yaml`` —
``crash_event`` and ``rig_composure_spec``):

  1. Driver Edge loses 1.
  2. An ``injury`` status is appended (severity :class:`StatusSeverity.Wound`
     per ADR-080 + the ``injury_system`` rules block — injuries persist
     beyond the scene).
  3. A ``dismounted`` status is appended (severity :class:`StatusSeverity.Scar`
     per the ``dismounted_rules`` block — recovery is "a story arc, not a
     shopping trip").
  4. An OTEL ``rig_pool.crash_event`` span fires with the rig + character
     identifiers plus optional ``location`` / ``attacker`` attrs per
     ADR-031.

:func:`apply_rig_damage` is the production-facing seam combining
:meth:`RigComposurePool.apply_delta` with this handler so downstream
callers (combat resolver, dogfight subsystem) get a single entry point
rather than re-implementing the delta-then-branch pattern at every site.
