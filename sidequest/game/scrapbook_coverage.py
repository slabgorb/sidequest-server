"""Scrapbook coverage gap detection on save resume (Story 45-10).

Playtest 3 evidence (2026-04-19): Orin's session covered 29 narrative
rounds but only 10 of those rounds had scrapbook entries. The other 19
were invisible to the recap injection subsystem; the narrator silently
invented continuity. Cause was benign (save predated scrapbook subsystem
being live); damage was real.

This module is the read-side hygiene the bug demanded — fires every
save-resume, computes the round-by-round coverage gap, and emits two
OTEL spans + a watcher event so the GM panel surfaces gaps loudly.
Read-only (no backfill); the context-story-45-10.md decision for
warn-only is intentional — backfill would manufacture diamond from
coal (ADR-014 inverse).

Post-45-11 invariant: ``narrative_log.round_number == turn_manager.interaction``,
and ``scrapbook_entries.turn_id`` is set from the same interaction
counter at emit time. So scrapbook coverage maps directly to round
number without an explicit join through narrative_log.
