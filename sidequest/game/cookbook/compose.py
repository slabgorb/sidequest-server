"""compose_room_prose — deterministic per-region prose + manifest.

Story 55-1 / ADR-109 §5.2. Pure function consumed by
``assemble_region``. The dressing pool feeds ``flavor_only`` entities;
the per-region special rooms feed ``real_object`` entities with
``binding.kind = location_feature`` and affordances seeded from the
special's ``mechanic`` id.

All entities carry ``provenance="cookbook"`` — this is the seam the
ADR-100 KnownFacts / Story 54-6 promotion paths use to tell authored
content from procedurally composed content.

The RNG must be seeded by the caller from
``(campaign_seed, expansion_id, room_id)`` so re-materialization of the
same region produces identical output. ``assemble_region`` derives this
seed from its own ``region_rng`` plus the ``room_id`` so the
deterministic chain is end-to-end.

The function refuses to fabricate prose: a ``LookDef`` with an empty
dressing pool raises ``ValueError`` loudly (No Silent Fallbacks).
``validate_bundle`` is the upstream guard that should catch this at
load time; the runtime guard here is a final safety net that names the
offending ``LookDef`` so dev sees WHICH bundle entry needs content.
