"""Turn management — phase tracking, round counting, and barrier semantics.

Two-tier turn model:
- interaction (granular): increments every player-narrator exchange.
  Powers fact/item discovery chronology. Monotonic, never resets.
- round (display): advances in lockstep with ``interaction`` via
  ``record_interaction()`` (Story 45-11, Strategy A). Shown to the
  player. The earlier "advances on narrative beats" model was never
  wired into the resolution pipeline — ``advance_round()`` had zero
  callers and the counter froze, drifting from
  ``MAX(narrative_log.round_number)`` over long sessions
  (Felix's Playtest 3: round=65 / max=72).

ADR-006: Both counters always increment, never reset.
Persisted across sessions — loading a save restores exact counts.
