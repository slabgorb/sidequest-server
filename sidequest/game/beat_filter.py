"""Per-class beat filter — single source of truth for 'what can the player do this turn?'.

Per spec docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-08-cnc-bx-class-beats-morale-design.md §4.3
and 2026-05-06 magic-system spec §3.5 (memorization wiring, story 47-10).

The filter resolves three independent gates:

  1. class_filter on each beat (None = universal; non-empty = whitelist)
  2. class_def.encounter_beat_choices intersection (per-class whitelist)
  3. cast_spell resource gates:
     a. slot gate — spell_slots_remaining >= 1.0
     b. prepared-list gate — actor has at least one spell prepared at any
        level (story 47-10 dual-plugin pivot)

The slot and prepared-list gates fail independently, with distinct OTEL
reasons so the GM panel can tell "Mage out of slots" from "Mage didn't
memorize anything this morning". The two gates are NOT collapsed into one.
