"""Room-graph movement — Slice E provides the chargen-time init surface only.

This module exposes :func:`init_room_graph_location`. The runtime
movement surface (``validate_room_transition``, ``apply_validated_move``,
``build_room_graph_explored``) belongs to the per-turn dispatch pipeline
and lands with the narrator runtime in a later story.

No silent fallback: a room graph declared ``room_graph`` mode but
carrying no room tagged ``entrance`` is an authoring bug. We raise
:class:`RoomGraphInitError`; the dispatch caller decides whether to
log-and-continue (chargen must not hard-fail) or propagate.

    confrontations that match the entered room AND pass the cooldown gate.

    ``room_id`` accepts three forms:

    1. Chassis-prefixed ``"<chassis_id>:<room_local>"`` — explicit form
       used by tests and callers that already know the chassis context.
    2. Chassis-qualified narrator form ``"<Chassis Name> — <Display>"``
       (em-dash with surrounding spaces) — what the narrator actually
       emits as ``location``. Stripped via ``rsplit`` and resolved by
       falling through to (3).
    3. Bare world-name like ``"Galley"`` — case-insensitive match
       against ``chassis.interior_rooms`` across all registered chassis.

    Inputs that match none of these resolve to no chassis and emit
    ``room.entry_skipped`` (reason ``not_chassis_room`` or
    ``chassis_not_found``); map-graph rooms are handled by the legacy
    room-graph machinery upstream of this hook.

    Story 47-4 wires Galley entry → ``the_tea_brew``. Story 47-6 adds the
    em-dash matcher, OTEL on every silent-return path, and splits the
    cooldown gate out of ``find_eligible_room_autofire`` so the
    ``room.entry_evaluated`` span can distinguish ``eligible_count``
    (matched room+bond) from ``fired_count`` (matched AND off cooldown).

    Story 47-6 + post-merge with 45-43: confrontations are read from
    ``snap.magic_state.confrontations`` (canonical store after the
    snapshot split-brain cleanup) filtered to ``register == "intimate"``
    so world-scoped bar-DSL entries don't appear here.

    OTEL: every return path emits either ``room.entry_skipped`` (with
    ``reason``) or ``room.entry_evaluated`` (with ``eligible_count`` and
    ``fired_count``); per-firing ``rig.confrontation_outcome`` and
