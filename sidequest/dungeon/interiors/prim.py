"""Randomized-Prim variant maze generator.

Port of maze-maker lib/maze_maker/prim.rb. NOT classical priority-queue
Prim: it sows `density` seed points and extends each `complexity` steps
by carving to a random WALL two-step neighbor. May leave isolated
pockets by design — that is the documented maze-maker behavior.
