"""Beneath Sünden — per-turn region projection (the BETTER fix, seam 1+2).

The materialized dungeon (``dungeon_map`` / ``RegionGraph``) is durable
truth in SQLite. Each narration turn this module projects the party's
*current* region — its theme register/flavor/motifs, its depth tone, and
its concrete adjacent region ids + edge kinds — into a structured
``RegionProjection``.

Two consumers, one source:

1. **Narrator prompt** — ``RegionProjection`` is rendered as a
   high-attention "you are here" section (gaslight discipline: a
   structured canonical-state section like the NPC roster, NOT an
   appended ``exits:`` advisory string). This is what stops the narrator
   improvising geography.
2. **Constrained move vocabulary** — the projection hands the narrator
   the *real* adjacent region ids. When the narrator emits a
   ``current_region`` WorldStatePatch it targets a VALID graph node, so
   ``frontier_hook.notify_region_transition`` fires on a real id and the
   look-ahead worker expands the dungeon — instead of location advancing
   by parsing invented scene titles.

Re-derived every turn from ``DungeonStore.load_map`` (single source of
truth — never mirrored onto the persisted snapshot; this codebase has a
documented snapshot-vs-SQLite divergence disease the recency window was
explicitly moved off the snapshot to cure).

No Silent Fallbacks: a current_region that is not a node in the graph,
or a theme id absent from the palette, raises loudly — that is a real
materialization/seed bug, never a quiet empty projection.
