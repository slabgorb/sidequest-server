"""Beneath Sünden Plan 7 Task 6 — frontier-crossing / frontier-approach
region-transition seam.

This is the **producer side** of the look-ahead wiring seam: a thin,
real observer-dispatch hook installed on the **real production
region-transition path** — ``GameSnapshot._apply_world_patch_inner``'s
``patch.current_region`` apply (the ADR-011 ``WorldStatePatch`` apply that
production uses: the narrator escape-hatch tool
``sidequest/agents/tools/apply_world_patch.py`` and
``sidequest/server/dispatch/monster_manual_inject.py`` both flow through
``GameSnapshot.apply_world_patch``). It is NOT a parallel navigation path
and NOT a stub.

Why this point (and not ``room_movement``): ``room_movement.py``'s
runtime surface (``validate_room_transition`` / ``apply_validated_move``)
is explicitly deferred to a later story (see its module docstring) and is
ROOM-level — orthogonal to the REGION transition the materializer's
frontier needs. The only code that mutates ``snap.current_region``
mid-session is the ``patch.current_region`` apply; ADR-055's region INIT
(``region_init.init_region_location``) is turn-1 only. So the
frontier-crossing hook lands here, extending the patch-apply
region-transition + ADR-055 ``region_init`` dedup-append semantics.

Two responsibilities (spec §7):

1. **Frontier-approach** — when the party transitions toward an
   unexpanded frontier edge, the registered observers are notified so a
   look-ahead materialization can be enqueued. Task 6 ships the **real
   dispatch seam**; the async worker that consumes it (idempotency,
   ``lookahead_breadth``, background execution) is **Task 7** — it
   ``register_frontier_observer``s itself. Until then the registry is
   genuinely empty: a real seam with zero consumers, the
   ``telemetry.watcher_hub`` honest-deferral precedent (NOT a stub — the
   producer is fully wired into production).

2. **Frontier-crossing → promote-to-active** — the committed expansion
   is already *live* from Task 6's commit transaction (it is in
   ``dungeon_map``). "Promote to active" is the minimal real
   session/region state recognition: the crossed-into region is
   dedup-appended into ``snap.discovered_regions`` exactly as ADR-055
   ``region_init.init_region_location`` does for the starting region
   (extending that contract to look-ahead-materialized regions, NOT a
   new mechanism).

OTEL: every fired transition emits ``frontier.region_transition`` so the
GM panel (the lie detector) sees the seam engaged rather than trusting
narration that the dungeon grew (the OTEL Observability Principle).

No Silent Fallbacks: an observer that raises propagates loudly (a broken
look-ahead enqueue is a real bug, never swallowed). The hook fires ONLY
on a genuine region change (different non-empty ``to_region``), never on
an unrelated patch.

    Two real effects, in order:
