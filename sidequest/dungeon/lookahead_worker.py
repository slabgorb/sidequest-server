"""Beneath Sünden Plan 7 Task 7 — async look-ahead WORKER.

This is the **consumer side** of Task 6's frontier-approach producer
seam (``frontier_hook.register_frontier_observer`` /
``notify_region_transition``). When the party transitions toward an
unexpanded frontier edge, the pipeline runs *ahead of the party*
asynchronously: the worker materialises the next expansion in the
background so the dungeon has already grown by the time the party
arrives. ``lookahead_breadth`` controls how many edges along the heading
are prefetched (default 1 — only the single approaching edge).

THE CENTRAL DESIGN CONSTRAINT
-----------------------------
``notify_region_transition`` is **synchronous**, called from
``GameSnapshot._apply_world_patch_inner`` AFTER ``snap.current_region``
is already set (the region transition ALREADY SUCCEEDED). The registered
observer here is a **thin sync function** that *schedules* the async
worker as a fire-and-forget background task and returns immediately
WITHOUT raising. The observer MUST NOT let the worker's failure (or its
own scheduling failure) propagate synchronously out of
``notify_region_transition`` → ``_apply_world_patch_inner`` — doing so
would abort the party's region crossing for a mere background-prefetch
problem (core-gameplay fragility). "Loud" therefore means a
GM-panel-visible terminal ``frontier.lookahead`` OTEL span (the
lie-detector), NEVER an exception into the synchronous transition path.
A background failure is never silently swallowed — the done-callback
surfaces it on the terminal span.

Idempotency
-----------
An in-flight ``frontier_edge_id`` registry serialises rapid successive
approach signals: a second signal for an already-in-flight materialisation
is a NO-OP (``deduped=true`` on its span — the lie-detector proof), NOT a
double-materialise. The in-flight marker is cleared when the worker
finishes (success OR failure) so a later genuine re-approach can retry.

Dependency injection
--------------------
``register_lookahead_worker`` closes over an EXPLICIT session context
(persistence/bundle/palette/pack_tropes/claude_client/campaign_seed/
lookahead_breadth) — the snapshot delivered by the producer carries none
of these, so they are passed in, never magically sourced (No Silent
Fallbacks). It returns a :class:`LookaheadWorkerHandle` so the session
lifecycle can ``.unregister()`` at teardown.
