"""Beneath Sünden Plan 7 session-integration — the live wiring seam.

The only new production seam (spec Decision 5 / Approach A). Two
functions called from exactly two one-line incisions in the WS session
lifecycle: register the merged look-ahead worker for the session's life,
and bootstrap the Seed=Expansion-0 dungeon on the first open of a
campaign. All dungeon/bootstrap/dep-resolution complexity is isolated
here so the hot session subsystem stays thin.

No Silent Fallbacks: every unresolved dep raises loudly; the genre/world
gate returns None (a clean no-op) only for worlds this dungeon does not
apply to.
