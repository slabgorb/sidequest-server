"""TurnRecord — immutable snapshot of a completed dispatch turn.

Assembled at the end of session_handler._execute_narration_turn and put
on the validator queue. Frozen for immutability across the queue boundary.

Per ADR-089 §2.1 (deliberate departure from Rust ADR-031), Python stores
snapshot_before_hash + snapshot_after + delta rather than two full
GameSnapshot clones — same validation power without the double-clone
cost on every turn.
