"""Process-wide pub/sub for WatcherEvent broadcasts.

Lives in `sidequest.telemetry` rather than `sidequest.server` so subsystem
code (orchestrator, game, genre) can publish semantic events without
pulling in FastAPI / uvicorn at import time. Importing
`sidequest.server.watcher` would trigger `sidequest.server.__init__`,
which imports `app.py`, which imports `uvicorn` — and uvicorn
reconfigures logging handlers at import, breaking pytest's caplog
fixture.

The FastAPI-facing pieces (WebSocket endpoint, OTEL SpanProcessor) live
in `sidequest.server.watcher` and import from here.

Reload safety: under ``uvicorn --reload`` the module is re-imported
whenever source files change. A naïve module-level ``watcher_hub =
WatcherHub()`` would create a fresh singleton on every reload, orphaning
any OTEL span processors registered against the previous instance and
turning the dashboard deaf once the first reload fires. We pin the hub
to a builtins attribute so the same instance survives re-imports of
this module within the same interpreter.
