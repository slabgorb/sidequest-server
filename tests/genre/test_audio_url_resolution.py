"""Verify that audio paths are URL-resolved at GenrePack load time.

Wires :func:`sidequest.server.asset_urls.resolve_asset_url` into the audio
loader so the UI receives full URLs (not bare relative paths) for every
path-bearing field on ``AudioConfig``:

* ``mood_tracks[mood][i].path``
* ``sfx_library[bucket][i]`` (list of bare strings)
* ``themes[i].variations[j].path``
* ``faction_themes[i].track.path``

This is the wiring test for Task 8 of the R2 media migration plan: it
exercises the production code path (``load_genre_pack``) against a real
genre pack rather than constructing ``AudioConfig`` by hand.
