"""Story 47-10 AC2 — Mage/Cleric ship magic_config in classes.yaml.

The cnc-bx work added `magic_access: innate_v1` to Mage and Cleric. This
story adds the `magic_config` block (tradition, slot tables, save DC stat,
turn_undead) that `seed_learned_v1_state` reads at session init to populate
known_spells, prepared_spells, and per-level slot ledger bars.

These tests load the live caverns_and_claudes/classes.yaml from the content
repo and assert each caster class declares the contract `seed_learned_v1_state`
expects. Failures here mean the content side hasn't shipped yet.
