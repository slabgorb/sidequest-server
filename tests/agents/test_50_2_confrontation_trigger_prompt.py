"""Story 50-2 — prompt-engineering RED tests.

Source: 2026-05-13 pingpong-archive triage. PR #177 added the OTEL warning
span ``confrontation.skipped_with_trigger_keywords`` but the implicit
"fixed" work — actually steering the narrator to emit ``confrontation``
on trigger prose for every confrontation category the genre offers —
was never done. The warning currently fires as steady-state on Victoria
turns because the prompt's TRIGGER CRITERIA enumeration is missing the
Victoria-pack social types (scandal, social_duel, trial, auction) and
the Recency-zone restatement also omits them.

Scope (per session SM Assessment):
- The fix is the prompt, NOT the keyword detector.
- No keyword-list editing in ``_CONFRONTATION_TRIGGER_PATTERNS``.
- The OTEL warning span flips role from "fix indicator" to
  "regression detector". These tests pin the prompt content so the
  flip is real.

AC trigger keywords from the story: chase, intercept, scandal,
negotiation, social_duel, trial, auction. The seven cover the union of
movement (chase / intercept-via-ship-combat), social-mechanical
(negotiation), and Victoria social-pack types (scandal, social_duel,
trial, auction).
