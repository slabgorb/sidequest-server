"""Story 50-24 AC-2 — narrator→ADR-074 seam for player-actor checks.

Source: /Users/slabgorb/Projects/sq-playtest-pingpong.md, "OQ-2 ARCHITECT
RESOLUTION" bullet under the "Narrator fabricates dice" headline
(Architect/OQ-2, 2026-05-17).

Root cause (Architect-resolved, missing-wire defect): the SDK narrator
has no instruction OR mechanism to push a player-actor uncertain
outcome through the player-facing roll path (opposed_check /
ADR-074 ``DICE_REQUEST``). The opposed_check machinery itself is fully
built and wired — see tests/server/test_opposed_check_wiring.py — but it
only engages *inside an active structured confrontation*. The fabricated
rolls in the coyote_star session were *ad-hoc* player checks
(negotiation / stealth / info: "A 16 buys real currency", "17 on the
run, clean and fast", "11, good enough for the dark") that never entered
a structured encounter, so they fell to the free-text path where, by
``BeatSelection.outcome`` design, "the narrator emits it".

AC-2 (verbatim from the story context):
- SDK narrator must have instruction AND mechanism to select
  ``ResolutionMode.opposed_check`` / request a player-facing throw for
  player-actor checks
- Narrator must FORBID free-text tier-emission for player-actor
  uncertainty (the way §4 forbids unstructured confrontation resolution)
- Narrator must defer the outcome tier to the returned ADR-074 face,
  not pre-write it

SCOPE: AC-2's deterministic surface is the prompt CONTRACT plus the
production prompt-selection seam. The end-to-end "the live LLM actually
emits a roll request" is non-deterministic and NOT unit-testable here;
the *engine entrypoint* for ad-hoc (non-confrontation) player rolls is a
Dev design decision for the GREEN phase — flagged in Delivery Findings.
These tests pin the contract that proves the gap, mirroring 50-2.
