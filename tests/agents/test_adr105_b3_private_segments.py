"""ADR-105 B3 — SDK-narrator public-safe output contract.

The shared NARRATION ``text`` is public-safe by the amended output
contract; PC-private perception is partitioned by the narrator at
generation time into ``private_segments`` and travels its own
NARRATION_SEGMENT channel, firewalled by the visibility-gated
CoreInvariant (B1).

These prove the durable plumbing:
  - the game_patch extractor parses + sanitizes ``private_segments``
  - both result assemblers carry ``private_prose_segments`` (the
    firewall must hold on the SDK path AND the streaming path — they
    build the result differently)
  - NARRATION_SEGMENT round-trips through the replay rebuilder
  - a NARRATION_SEGMENT projected through the PRODUCTION ComposedFilter
    excludes a non-owner (the new kind is firewalled end-to-end by B1)
