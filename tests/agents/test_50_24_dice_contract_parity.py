"""Story 50-24 AC-1 — SDK narrator prompt §7 (DICE RESOLUTION) contract parity.

Source: /Users/slabgorb/Projects/sq-playtest-pingpong.md, "OQ-2 ARCHITECT
RESOLUTION" bullet under the "Narrator fabricates dice" headline
(Architect/OQ-2, 2026-05-17).

Root cause (Architect-resolved, leg C): the ADR-101/102 SDK-narrator
migration replaced the engine-forced dice authority (output_only.md:89
"the engine will overwrite this from the actual roll") with
``output_only_sdk.md`` §7 — the ONLY one of the eight tool-owned
categories with no MUST/MANDATORY, no trigger enumeration, and a
self-gating clause ("When the prose hinges on an uncertain outcome the
engine should resolve") that a model which already wrote "A 16 buys
real currency" reads as *already resolved* → not required to call the
tool. The contract licensed the fabrication.

AC-1 (verbatim from the story context):
- §7 promoted to MUST/MANDATORY parity with the other seven categories
- Trigger enumeration added (matching the §4 pattern)
- The self-gating clause DELETED — it is the loophole

TEST-DESIGN NOTE (test-paranoia): the sibling 50-2 prompt tests assert
substrings against the *whole* ``NARRATOR_OUTPUT_ONLY`` blob. That is
correct for 50-2 (it hunts type-name tokens that appear nowhere else)
but would be VACUOUS here: "MUST"/"MANDATORY" appear all over this
prompt for §1-§6/§8, so a whole-document "MUST present" assertion
always passes regardless of §7. Every AC-1 assertion below therefore
operates on the *sliced §7 section text*, not the whole document.
