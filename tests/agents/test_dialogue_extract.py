"""Unit tests for extract_spoken_lines (MP dialogue visibility fix).

Playtest 2026-05-17 (Keith + Sebby): when a player types quoted dialogue
to an NPC in a multiplayer session, peers never see the spoken words —
only the narrator's reply. The SOUL.md Agency rule (describe the world,
not the player) correctly stops the narrator from echoing the line, and
NarrationPayload has no field for it, so the player's speech is lost on
barrier-fire (ACTION_REVEAL CLEARED wipes the wait-phase reveal).

``extract_spoken_lines`` pulls the verbatim quoted spans out of a
player's submitted action so they can be surfaced, attributed, into the
shared transcript. Pure string transform — reuses the same dialogue
regex pov_swap already uses (single-sourced via ``_split_by_dialogue``).

These tests RED until ``sidequest.agents.pov_swap.extract_spoken_lines``
exists.
