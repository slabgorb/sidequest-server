"""ADR-107 — read-only AsideResolver answer policy (RED, story 50-25).

Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-aside-channel.md Task 3.
Fails until Dev creates sidequest/agents/aside_resolver.py (GREEN).

The resolver is a GM ruling, not a story beat: it takes a read view +
question, asks the LLM behind a Protocol, and returns a structured
resolution. It has NO write path — "no turn consumed" is enforced by
the object having no hands (test_resolver_has_no_write_surface).

# out → outcome=resolver_error + ERROR-level log. No turn is lost."
# Reviewer HIGH: the current `except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError,
# KeyError, TypeError)` catches malformed *output* only; a raising
# `complete()` (timeout / connection / API error) escapes and crashes the
# PLAYER_ACTION handler. These tests pin the call-failure contract. They
# must NOT pass with a bare `except Exception` mindset — they assert the
# *spec-named* failure modes (timeout, connection) decline gracefully;
# they do not assert that arbitrary programming bugs are swallowed.
