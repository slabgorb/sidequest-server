"""Verify dispatch surfaces PC spoken dialogue to the whole MP party.

Playtest 2026-05-17 (Keith + Sebby): quoted dialogue a player typed to
an NPC never reached peers — only the narrator's reply did. The fix
extracts the verbatim quoted spans from each drained action and
broadcasts them, attributed to the speaking PC, to every socket in the
room (exclude_socket_id=None — the speaker's own transcript shows it
too), so the spoken line survives barrier-fire instead of being wiped
with the ACTION_REVEAL CLEARED.

These tests RED until ``PlayerSpeechMessage`` / ``SpokenLinePayload``
and ``_broadcast_player_speech_to_party`` exist.
