"""ADR-107 — mandatory MP wiring test (RED, story 50-25). THE CENTERPIECE.

Plan: docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-17-aside-channel.md Task 5.
Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-17-aside-channel-design.md §7.

Drives the REAL ``PlayerActionHandler.handle()`` against a real
``SessionRoom`` (MULTIPLAYER) + real ``GameSnapshot`` + ``TurnManager``
+ ``SqliteStore`` + loaded genre pack, asserting ALL SEVEN out-of-band
guarantees — the wiring test that proves the aside channel is connected
end-to-end (CLAUDE.md "Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test"), not
merely that the resolver works in isolation.

The aside path is exercised 100% real. Only the orthogonal narrator is
stubbed: ``tests/handlers/_harness.py``'s ``_StubSession`` skips the LLM
prose but performs the *real* ``turn_manager.record_interaction()`` the
production narrator does after a barrier fires, so round-advance stays
faithful. The plan's Task 5 "factor from a sibling MP fixture" premise
did not hold (every handler test is ``MagicMock``-based); the harness
builds the real objects from scratch instead — see its module docstring.
