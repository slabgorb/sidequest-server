"""Tests for ``scripts/audit_namegen_corpora.py`` (Story 45-28).

The audit script is the wire-first treatment for AC1 (corpus size
audit) — it must hit the actual culture-loading path
(``sidequest.genre.load_genre_pack``), resolve every culture's
``corpora`` references to disk paths, count words, and produce a
markdown report with three sections:

- **OK** — corpus ≥ ``WARN_BELOW_WORDS``
- **THIN** — ``FAIL_BELOW_WORDS`` ≤ corpus < ``WARN_BELOW_WORDS``
- **FAIL** — corpus < ``FAIL_BELOW_WORDS``

Exit code:

- ``0`` if no FAIL rows (THIN allowed — those are warnings, not gates)
- ``1`` if any FAIL row (CI gate signal)
- ``2`` reserved for invocation errors (missing pack, bad ``--path``)

The architect context (``Audit script — wire-first applied to content``)
specifies modeling on ``audit_content_drift.py``. Tests pin the
contract: shape of the output, exit code semantics, and the
content-state regression (post-expansion no THIN rows for the three
named corpora).
