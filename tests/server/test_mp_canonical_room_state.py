"""Regression guards for the 2026-04-26 multiplayer fix.

Two defects collapsed multiplayer to "two parallel solo games on one
slug" (playtest 2026-04-26 Fonzie/Richie / Mawdeep):

1. ``_handle_character_creation_complete`` reassigned ``sd.snapshot``
   to the freshly materialized world snapshot, orphaning the
   ``room._snapshot`` reference. ``room.save()`` then persisted the
   stale pre-chargen snapshot. The next peer connecting loaded an
   empty save, treated themselves as the first commit, materialized
   their own world, and ran a divergent narrator session.

2. Each WS session constructed its own ``Orchestrator`` at connect
   time. ADR-067 mandates a single persistent narrator session per
   slug — two orchestrators meant two ``--resume`` ids, which meant
   two narrators producing two unrelated scenes.

These tests pin the fixes so they don't regress.
