"""RED tests for Story 50-18 — POST /dev/scene/{name} dev-gated endpoint.

Wire-level + watcher-level integration tests for the scene-harness HTTP
endpoint specified in ADR-092. The endpoint hydrates a fixture YAML into
a GameSnapshot, persists via SqliteStore, and returns the minted slug —
all gated behind ``DEV_SCENES=1`` so production builds carry zero surface.

Contract under test (ADR-092 §Decision):

1. ``POST /dev/scene/{name}`` is registered ONLY when ``DEV_SCENES=1`` is
   set when ``create_app()`` runs. With the env var unset, the route does
   not appear in ``app.routes`` and a POST to it returns 404 (FastAPI's
   default for an unmatched path).
2. On success, returns ``{"slug": "<game_slug>"}`` and the save file is
   present at ``db_path_for_slug(save_dir, slug)`` with the hydrated
   snapshot in ``game_state``.
3. Missing fixture → 404 with the missing path in the JSON body.
4. Hydration error → 422 with field-level detail.
5. OTEL: emits ``scene_harness.intent.load``, ``.hydrate.ok``, ``.persist.ok``
   spans on the success path; ``.hydrate.error`` on the failure path.
6. The route is wired in through the production ``create_app()`` factory,
   not via a hand-built test app — verifies real integration per CLAUDE.md
   "Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test".

All tests currently RED — the route, hydrator, and span helpers do not
exist yet (ADR-092 implementation-status: partial; ADR-087 P0).
