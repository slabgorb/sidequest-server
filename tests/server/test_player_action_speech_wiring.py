"""Wiring test: the MP dispatch path surfaces PC speech to the party.

CLAUDE.md mandates an integration test proving the component is reached
from production code. This drives ``_handle_player_action`` end-to-end
for two players (mocked narrator). It asserts that a player's quoted
dialogue is broadcast as a PLAYER_SPEECH to the room *before* the
ACTION_REVEAL CLEARED wipes the wait-phase strip — i.e. the spoken
line survives barrier-fire into the shared transcript.
