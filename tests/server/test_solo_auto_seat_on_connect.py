"""Regression tests for playtest 2026-04-30 — notorious_party_gate
``player_count=0`` race at solo session boot.

Pre-fix flow:
1. Solo session connects via slug-connect.
2. ``room.connect(player_id, ...)`` is called — adds to ``_connected``
   (transport-level) but does NOT add to ``_seated`` (lobby-level).
3. The UI never sends PLAYER_SEAT for solo (PLAYER_SEAT is the MP
   slot-claim message), so ``_handle_player_seat`` never runs and
   ``room._seated`` stays empty for the entire session.
4. On turn 1, ``_build_turn_context`` reads
   ``room.non_abandoned_player_count()`` → 0 → ``orchestrator.notorious_
   party_gate`` warns ``player_count=0 (<= 0) — impossible state,
   defaulting to safe-empty``. Party context unavailable for narrator.

The lobby state machine (CONNECTED → CHARGEN → PLAYING → ABANDONED) is
mode-agnostic: solo IS in the lobby, the difference is only that the
UI doesn't send the explicit slot-claim message. The fix mirrors the
mode in the server.

Fix:
- Solo connect auto-seats the player in the room. Idempotent — already-
  seated players (reconnect, test fixtures) skip the seat() call.
- Returning solo (has_character=True) immediately transitions
  CHARGEN → PLAYING. Mirrors the ``_handle_player_seat`` returning-
  player path. New solo (state=Creating) is promoted later by the
  chargen-complete flow's existing ``transition_to_playing`` call.
- MP connects do NOT auto-seat — they still require the explicit
  PLAYER_SEAT message (preserves the lobby-claim flow).
