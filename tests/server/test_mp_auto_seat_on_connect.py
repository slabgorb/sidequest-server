"""Regression tests for playtest 2026-04-30 — multiplayer
``playing_player_count=1`` race after returning-player reconnect.

Pre-fix flow (4-player MP playtest):
1. All 4 players complete chargen — saved with characters in
   ``snapshot.characters`` and ``snapshot.player_seats``.
2. Local-storage clear / refresh on each tab triggers a fresh slug-
   connect for each player_id with ``has_character=True``.
3. ``connect.py`` auto-seat block skips MP (gated on
   ``mode == GameMode.SOLO``) — so neither ``room.seat()`` nor
   ``transition_to_playing()`` runs in the connect path for MP.
4. The PLAYER_SEAT path (``handlers/player_seat.py``) is the only
   MP promotion site, but it requires the client to (re-)send
   ``PLAYER_SEAT`` AND ``session._state is _State.Playing`` at that
   moment. After a reconnect with an existing character, those
   conditions don't always coincide — so most MP returning players
   stay in CHARGEN with their seat untransitioned.
5. ``room.playing_player_count()`` returns 1 (or 0). The cinematic
   barrier (``ADR-036`` wired in ``handlers/player_action.py``)
   fires on the first player's submission with ``player_count=1``,
   the narrator dispatches solo-style, and the other three players'
   submissions vanish into a closed round.

The lobby state machine (CONNECTED → CHARGEN → PLAYING → ABANDONED)
is mode-agnostic. Solo got its connect-path auto-promote fixed in
``test_solo_auto_seat_on_connect.py``. MP returning needs the same
treatment — without breaking the explicit-PLAYER_SEAT contract for
**new** MP players (no character yet).

Fix:
- Connect auto-seats when ``mode == SOLO`` OR ``has_character``.
- ``has_character`` returning players (solo OR MP) immediately
  transition CHARGEN → PLAYING. Mirrors the
  ``_handle_player_seat`` returning-player path that was MP-only
  before. Idempotent — already-seated players (reconnect, test
  fixtures) skip the seat() call.
- New MP connects (``has_character=False``) still do NOT auto-seat;
  they go through PLAYER_SEAT explicitly so the lobby-claim flow
  preserves intent.
