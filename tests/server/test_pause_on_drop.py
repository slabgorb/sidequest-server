"""Integration: narrator pauses when a seated player disconnects (MP-02 Task 6).

Verifies:
1. When all seated players are present, PLAYER_ACTION dispatches to the narrator.
2. When a seated player disconnects, PLAYER_PRESENCE{disconnected} is broadcast
   followed by GAME_PAUSED with the absent player listed in waiting_for.
3. A PLAYER_ACTION sent while paused returns GAME_PAUSED (not narration) and does
   NOT call the narrator dispatch method.
4. When the absent player reconnects, GAME_RESUMED is broadcast to the room.

Uses caverns_and_claudes / grimvault (genre/world available in the content repo).
