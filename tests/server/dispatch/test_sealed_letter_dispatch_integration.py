"""End-to-end integration tests for the sealed-letter dispatch wiring (T5).

T3 added ``resolve_sealed_letter_lookup`` and unit-tested it in isolation.
T5 wires it into the production confrontation resolution path so that a
real game turn arriving for a confrontation with
``resolution_mode == sealed_letter_lookup`` actually fires the dogfight
engine.

These tests drive the *production* dispatch entry point
(``_apply_narration_result_to_snapshot``) — not the resolver directly —
so they catch wiring regressions that unit tests of the handler can't see.

Coverage:
  - End-to-end: narrator emits dogfight confrontation + maneuver beat
    selections → snapshot's encounter has per_actor_state mutated, OTEL
    cell_resolved span fires, narration_hint pushed to encounter
  - Role assignment: instantiator special-cases sealed-letter
    confrontations to assign role="red" / "blue" rather than "combatant"
  - Validation: missing interaction_table raises, wrong actor count
    raises (CLAUDE.md no-silent-fallbacks)
  - Regression: legacy ``beat_selection`` confrontations still resolve
    via apply_beat — the new branch is additive, not destructive
  - Persistence: per_actor_state survives a snapshot model_dump round
    trip after sealed-letter resolution

Skips when ``sidequest-content`` is not checked out alongside
``sidequest-server`` (matches the pattern in ``test_dogfight_content_loading.py``).
