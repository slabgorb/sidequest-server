"""Shared pytest fixtures for sidequest-server server-layer tests.

Centralizes the Claude-client mock used by every dispatch test. Before
Story 2.3 Slice H the mock could be a bare ``AsyncMock()`` because
``_chargen_confirmation`` never invoked the orchestrator — the
narration path only fired on PLAYER_ACTION. Slice H routes an opening
turn through the orchestrator at confirmation, so every chargen test
now goes through the narrator pipeline and the mock has to return a
real :class:`ClaudeResponse` with non-empty text + session id.

Also installs a daemon guard: every test in this directory runs with
``DaemonClient`` replaced by an always-unavailable stub so that
narration-turn post-processing (lore embedding, image render) never
blocks on a real Unix-domain-socket round trip. Integration tests that
want to exercise the daemon path use an in-process fake
(``test_render_dispatch.py``'s asyncio Unix server,
``test_lore_rag_wiring.py``'s counting stub) — their
``monkeypatch.setattr`` call simply overrides the guard for that test.
No server test ever talks to the real ``/tmp/sidequest-renderer.sock``.

Also installs a genre-pack search-path guard: every test in this directory
resolves genre packs from ``tests/fixtures/packs/`` (the frozen fixture
pack at ``test_genre/`` with symlinks for each real genre slug) rather than
from ``sidequest-content/``. This makes the suite hermetic — no CI
dependency on the content submodule. Tests that construct
``WebSocketSessionHandler`` with an explicit ``genre_pack_search_paths``
argument (e.g. ``test_session_handler_slug_resumed.py``) bypass this
guard intentionally and must handle their own content-not-found skips.

@pytest.fixture
def otel_capture():
    """In-memory OTEL span exporter for span-assertion tests.

    Installs a ``SimpleSpanProcessor`` with an ``InMemorySpanExporter`` on
    the global ``TracerProvider`` so spans opened via ``Span.open`` (and
    any direct ``tracer.start_as_current_span`` call site) land in
    ``exporter.get_finished_spans()``.

    Yields the exporter; tears down the processor on exit so spans from
    one test never bleed into the next.

    **Provider reset (45-36 fix):** ``SimpleSpanProcessor.shutdown()``
    flushes pending spans but does NOT deregister the processor from the
    global ``TracerProvider``. Across a pytest session that uses this
    fixture N times, the provider accumulates N stale processors — they
    are shut-down so they no-op on emit, but they leak memory and any
    test that introspects the processor list sees ghosts. We clear the
    underlying ``_span_processors`` tuple before adding ours so each
    test starts from a clean slate.

    Replacing the ``TracerProvider`` itself does NOT work because
    production modules cache ``otel_trace.get_tracer(__name__)`` at
    import time (e.g., ``server/dispatch/chargen_loadout.py``) and a
    provider swap leaves those tracers bound to the old (now-orphaned)
    provider, which silently drops every span those modules emit.

    Reusable across stories — Story 45-10 (scrapbook coverage), Story 45-3
    (dice-throw momentum span), and any future server-layer test that
    asserts span emission. ``test_dice_throw_momentum_span.py`` still
    defines a local copy that shadows this fixture; it can be migrated in
    a follow-up.
