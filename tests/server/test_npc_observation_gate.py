"""Story 49-6 RED — Ratification gate for narrator_invented NPCs.

Background: Story 49-2 (completed 2026-05-12) added a server-side catch-loop
that auto-mints ``NpcPoolMember`` entries when the narrator names a person
via role (Father, mother, the doctor, ...) or honorific (Mrs. Gow, Dr.
Sallow, ...) in prose but omits them from ``npcs_present``. The mint is
fire-and-forget — once an NPC is in the pool it stays there.

That over-pins phantom NPCs. The Glenross 2026-05-11 playtest showed the
failure mode in reverse: turn 5 narrator wrote about Father; turn 6
narrator drifted to "the wee one's mother" — if both had been auto-minted
without a ratification step, the pool would carry Father and Mother (a
gender-flipped pair) forever, even though only one of them was a real
recurring character in the world.

This story closes the loop with a one-turn observation gate. Auto-minted
``NpcPoolMember`` entries are flagged ``observation_pending=True``. On
the next turn, the gate examines the narrator's ``npcs_present`` patch:
- Pending member referenced (by name OR role) → flag flips to False
  (member promoted to persistent pool status). Emits
  ``npc.observation_gate_promoted``.
- Pending member NOT referenced → removed from ``npc_pool`` entirely.
  Emits ``npc.observation_gate_purged``.

Non-pending pool members (world-authored, already-promoted, legacy
``narrator_invented`` migrated entries) are untouched.

Spec sources:
- ``.session/49-6-session.md`` — AC list (epic does not enumerate AC
  itself; SM derived from the story-context paragraph).
- ``sprint/epic-49.yaml`` — 49-6 story metadata, 49-2 sibling completed.

Contracts under test:

1. **Model change.** ``NpcPoolMember`` gains
   ``observation_pending: bool = False`` (default keeps legacy snapshots
   working — they read as already-ratified).

2. **OTEL spans.**
   - ``SPAN_NPC_OBSERVATION_GATE_PROMOTED = "npc.observation_gate_promoted"``
   - ``SPAN_NPC_OBSERVATION_GATE_PURGED = "npc.observation_gate_purged"``
   Both route to ``state_transition`` under ``component="npc_registry"``.
   Helpers ``npc_observation_gate_promoted_span`` /
   ``npc_observation_gate_purged_span`` exported from
   ``sidequest.telemetry.spans``.

3. **Auto-mint wiring.** ``_auto_mint_prose_only_npcs`` sets
   ``observation_pending=True`` on every member it appends to
   ``snapshot.npc_pool``.

4. **Gate function.** A new helper
   ``_apply_npc_observation_gate(*, snapshot, emitted_mentions,
   turn_num) -> None`` in ``sidequest.server.session_helpers`` evaluates
   every ``observation_pending=True`` pool member against
   ``emitted_mentions``: promote on match, purge on miss.

5. **Pipeline wiring.** ``_apply_narration_result_to_snapshot``
   invokes the gate BEFORE auto-mint runs for the current turn (so the
   gate examines the *prior* turn's pending members against the
   *current* turn's mentions, never the same turn's own freshly-minted
   members).

drop names that don't earn their place).
