"""Unit tests for the narration visibility classifier (Story 49-8).

Found in the 2026-05-12 playtest: ``websocket_session_handler.py:2955``
ships ``visibility_sidecar=None`` so every player receives every per-PC
narration card identically, third-person. The classifier produces the
sidecar dict that drives both:

  (a) per-recipient include/exclude via the existing ``visibility_tag``
      rule (``sidequest.game.projection.genre_stage``), and
  (b) 2nd-person POV swap on the recipient whose ``player_id`` maps to
      the card's ``anchor_pc`` character.

Lives at ``sidequest.server.visibility_classifier``. Contract:

    classify_narration_visibility(
        result: NarrationTurnResult,
        snapshot: GameSnapshot,
        connected_player_ids: list[str],
        player_id_to_character: dict[str, str],
    ) -> dict

Returns a sidecar dict with the v2 shape:

    {
      "visible_to": "all" | [player_id, ...],
      "fidelity":   {entity_id: fidelity_level},   # preserved from v1
      "anchor_pc":  "Carl" | None,
      "pov_strategy": "pc_anchored" | "atmospheric" | "private",
    }

Anchor inference order:
  1. If ``result.action_rewrite.named`` exists, extract the subject PC
     name from it.
  2. Else scan the first sentence of ``result.narration`` for a known
     PC name from ``snapshot.characters``.
  3. Else ``anchor_pc=None``, ``pov_strategy='atmospheric'``.

These tests RED until ``sidequest.server.visibility_classifier`` is
created. They prove:
  - the sidecar shape conforms,
  - anchor inference prefers structured field over prose,
  - atmospheric (no PC mention) returns None anchor,
  - existing v1 callers (visible_to / fidelity) still produce valid
    output (the new fields are purely additive).
