"""Wire-first boundary tests for Story 45-2 — turn barrier counts active
turn-takers, not lobby connections.

This file is the wire-first gate for the story. The unit-level state
machine lives in `tests/server/test_lobby_state_machine.py`; here we
exercise the actual barrier-decision seam via `_handle_player_action`
through the MP fixture.

The evropi scenario (Playtest 3, 2026-04-19): four save files clustered
at 16:30–16:31 UTC; only Rux played, but the structured-mode turn barrier
waited on all four lobby connections, so Rux hit barriers mid-solo. The
fix: the predicate at `session_handler.py:3222` reads
`room.playing_player_count()` instead of `room.seated_player_count()`,
and disconnect-during-chargen abandons the seat.

These tests are RED today: `playing_player_count()` does not exist;
`set_player_count()` is fed `seated_player_count()`; `barrier.wait` span
is not emitted; `LobbyState` is not defined.

See `sprint/context/context-story-45-2.md` for the full design.
