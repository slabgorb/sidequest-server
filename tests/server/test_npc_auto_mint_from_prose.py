"""Story 49-2 RED — Auto-mint NPCs from prose-only dialogue mentions.

ADR-098 dropped --resume; story 49-1 restored the recent-narration block
in Recency zone. The remaining 2026-05-11 Glenross wound: the narrator
wrote dialogue about Father in detail ("He's through the back passage —
the morning room, where Mrs. Gow laid him after", "gestures you ahead of
him", "set the secateurs down on the blotter") but emitted
``npcs_present=2`` covering only Reverend Murchison + the pinafore girl.
Father never made it into the NPC roster. Turn 6 then invented "the wee
one's mother / her" with no constraint to overrule.

Story 45-53 ships a recurring-presence detector (warn on KNOWN names
that got skipped). That covers turn N when the NPC was previously
extracted but dropped from this turn's structured emission. It does NOT
cover the FIRST mention — when the narrator names a person via role or
honorific in turn N's prose for the very first time and forgets to
extract them, there is no entry to "recur" against.

This story closes that gap with a server-side prose scanner that
auto-mints ``NpcPoolMember`` entries for role-named or honorific-named
individuals that the narrator's structured patch missed. Contract:

    def _auto_mint_prose_only_npcs(
        *,
        snapshot: GameSnapshot,
        narration_text: str,
        emitted_mentions: list[NpcMention],
        turn_num: int,
    ) -> None:
        '''Scan narration prose for role-named (Father, mother, son,
        daughter, the doctor, the Reverend, the constable, ...) and
        honorific-named (Mrs. <Name>, Mr. <Name>, Dr. <Name>, Reverend
        <Name>) individuals. For each that is NOT present in
        emitted_mentions, snapshot.npcs, or snapshot.npc_pool, infer
        pronouns from surrounding prose. If pronouns are unambiguous,
        append a NpcPoolMember(drawn_from="dialogue_extraction") and
        emit npc.auto_minted_from_prose. If pronouns are ambiguous
        (no pronoun nearby, or conflicting pronouns near the same role),
        log a warning and skip mint — never guess.'''

OTEL contract (separate from story 45-53's npc.auto_registered which
fires for structured-patch mints):
- New span ``SPAN_NPC_AUTO_MINTED_FROM_PROSE = "npc.auto_minted_from_prose"``
  in ``sidequest/telemetry/spans/npc.py`` with a ``SpanRoute`` so the
  watcher emits a ``state_transition`` event with
  ``op="auto_minted_from_prose"`` under ``component="npc_registry"``.
  Attributes: ``npc_name``, ``role``, ``pronouns``, ``source``,
  ``turn_number``.
- Helper context manager ``npc_auto_minted_from_prose_span(...)``
  exported from ``sidequest.telemetry.spans``.

Wiring contract:
- ``_apply_narration_result_to_snapshot`` must invoke the auto-minter
  AFTER ``_detect_missed_recurring_npcs`` so the recurring-presence
  detector still gets first crack at KNOWN names. The auto-minter
  then mints only FIRST-mention names.

OTEL Observability Principle (CLAUDE.md): the ambiguous-pronoun skip
path also fires an OTEL span (distinct event name) so Sebastien's GM
panel can see when the system bites its tongue. Without a span the
skip is invisible.
