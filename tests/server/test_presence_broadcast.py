"""Integration: PLAYER_PRESENCE is broadcast when a second player joins.

Verifies that:
1. When alice connects to a multiplayer game, no PLAYER_PRESENCE is sent yet.
2. When bob connects to the same game, alice receives a PLAYER_PRESENCE{state=connected}.
3. The PLAYER_PRESENCE carries bob's player_id.

Uses caverns_and_claudes / grimvault (genre/world available in the content repo).
