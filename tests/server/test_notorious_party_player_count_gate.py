"""RED-phase tests for Story 45-8: Notorious-party gating on session.player_count.

Playtest 3 (2026-04-19, evropi) regression: Rux — a named party member
seeded by the world configuration (the conceptual ``notorious_party``
fixture) — leaked into pumblestone_sweedlewit's solo-session narration.
The narrator referenced Rux by name despite pumblestone being the only
PLAYING player in the room.

Root cause traced to ``sidequest.server.session_helpers._build_turn_context``::

    party_peers: list[PartyPeer] = [
        PartyPeer.from_character(pc)
        for pc in snapshot.characters
        if pc.core.name != char_name
    ]

The list comprehension gates on **snapshot identity**, not on **session
player_count**. When a save (or world fixture) contains canonical PCs from
a previous full-party session — Rux, Hant, Ludzo, Prot'Thokk, Th'Rook —
they all survive the filter and ride into pumblestone's solo prompt.
Story 37-36 closed identity drift in multiplayer; 45-8 closes the inverse
leak in solo.

Acceptance criteria — see ``.session/45-8-session.md``:

  AC1  Solo session (player_count == 1) → notorious_party context fully
       gated out of narrator prompt context.
  AC2  Multiplayer (player_count > 1) → notorious_party seeds normally.
  AC3  OTEL span fires every turn carrying:
         - ``session.player_count`` (int)
         - ``notorious_party_gated`` (bool)
         - ``party_context_available`` (bool)
  AC4  No silent fallback — if the gating mechanism is broken/missing the
       narrator path must fail loud (OTEL event + structured log), never
       proceed with wrong context.
  AC5  Wiring test: spin a solo room with multiple known characters in
       the snapshot, build the turn context end-to-end, assert the prompt
       contains none of the named party members.

CLAUDE.md "Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test" — the suite below
covers (a) gating logic, (b) prompt-render integration, (c) OTEL
observability, (d) fail-loud behaviour, (e) end-to-end wiring from
``_SessionData`` → ``_build_turn_context`` → ``Orchestrator.build_narrator_prompt``.

Test paranoia (TEA discipline):
  - Solo with a single self character → already empty (covered by 37-36)
  - Solo with N>1 characters in snapshot → MUST be empty (45-8 RED)
  - Multiplayer with N>1 characters → MUST be populated (regression guard)
  - Boundary: player_count=2 (just over the gate) → seeds
  - room=None (gate machinery missing) → fail loud, no silent passthrough
