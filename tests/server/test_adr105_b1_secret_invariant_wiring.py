"""ADR-105 B1 — secret-routing CoreInvariant: production-path wiring test.

CLAUDE.md "Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test": the unit tests in
``tests/game/projection/test_core_invariants.py`` prove the invariant
branch in isolation. This proves the *chain* used in production:

    build_secret_note_events (production builder)
        → ComposedFilter (production filter, NO genre rules — the
          firewall must not depend on a pack's projection.yaml)
        → _project_frames (the exact per-recipient fan-out helper
          emit_event calls)

It is the test that would have caught the 2026-05-16 caverns_sunden
leak: a non-recipient's projected frame for a redacted dispatch must be
``include=False`` with ``rule.source == "invariant:visibility_gated"``,
and the ``invariant.secret_routed`` watcher event (the firewall's
lie-detector) must fire once per distinct recipient.

Regression anchor: before B1, ``TARGETED_KINDS["SECRET_NOTE"]="to"``
read a ``to`` field ``SecretNotePayload`` never carries, so EVERY
non-GM player resolved ``include=False`` — the channel was dead for
players (the legitimate recipient could not receive it either).
