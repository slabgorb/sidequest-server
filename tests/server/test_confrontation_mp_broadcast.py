"""Pingpong 2026-04-26 S2-BUG: Confrontations are PRIVATE to the acting player.

Repro from the Beatles 4-player session: Paul opened a Diplomatic Negotiation
vs Veriti Onua. Paul saw the confrontation card, NPC, and action buttons.
John, George, and Ringo's tabs froze on the prior shared beat — no NPC card,
no narration, no buttons.

Root cause: ``_execute_narration_turn`` built the ``ConfrontationMessage``
directly via ``ConfrontationMessage(...)`` and only appended it to the
acting player's ``outbound`` list — the same list returned to the caller
and pushed to the actor's socket. Peer sockets were never notified.

Fix: route the message through ``self._emit_event("CONFRONTATION", payload)``
so the canonical EventLog + ProjectionFilter fan-out path delivers a
per-player frame to every connected peer (mirrors NARRATION at L3365 of
session_handler.py).

This is a wiring test — it drives the actual ``_execute_narration_turn``
handler against a real :class:`SessionRoom` with four connected sockets
and asserts every non-acting peer's outbound queue receives a
CONFRONTATION frame.

    """Pingpong 2026-05-12 17:48: trailing-PC regression of Story 49-7.

    Repro from the 3-PC Carl/Donut/Katia caverns_sunden playtest: per-PC
    verb projection worked at confrontation-open, then after a couple of
    resolved rounds the dispatcher's Confrontation tab regressed to the
    full 16-button class union. oq-2 isolated the pattern: the broken
    tab was always the PC who appeared LAST in the resolved-round
    narration order — i.e. the one whose ``sd.player_id`` became the
    dispatcher for the merged-dispatch turn.

    Root cause: ``_emit_event("CONFRONTATION", ...)`` returns the raw
    unfiltered canonical payload as ``confrontation_msg`` for the
    emitter. The per-PC overlay loop above the dispatcher-current-socket
    push queues a class-filtered CONFRONTATION to every connected socket
    (including the dispatcher's). The dispatcher-current-socket push
    then queues the unfiltered ``confrontation_msg`` to the dispatcher's
    queue AFTER the filtered overlay. UI renders last-message-wins, so
    the dispatcher's tab snapped back to the full 16-button union.

    Fix: skip the canonical push to the dispatcher when the per-PC
    overlay above already queued a filtered frame for them. The
    canonical push remains the dispatcher's sole delivery path in the
    legacy/unseated branch (no PC seat / no class resolution / clear
    payload / stub-room fixtures).

    This test exercises the seated-PC branch with a real
    caverns_and_claudes genre pack so ``resolve_recipient_pc`` actually
    finds the Thief class for Katia. Asserts:

      1. Katia's queue receives exactly one CONFRONTATION (not two —
         no canonical-clobber after the filtered overlay).
      2. The frame Katia receives is Thief-filtered: contains
         ``backstab`` (Thief-specific) and DOES NOT contain
         ``shield_bash`` (Fighter), ``cast_spell`` (Mage), or
