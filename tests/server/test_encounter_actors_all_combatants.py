"""Story 45-18 — encounter.actors registers all combatants, not just player.

Wire-first RED tests for the bug discovered in Playtest 3 (Orin save):
6 rounds of combat with a "Crawling Scavenger" but ``encounter.actors``
contained only the player. Per-actor damage and per-side momentum tracking
were impossible because the opponent was never registered as a combatant.

These tests exercise the production wire end-to-end:

    snapshot.npcs (scene NPCs, post-Wave-2A canonical store)
        + narrator confrontation trigger
            → narration_apply._apply_narration_result_to_snapshot
                → encounter_lifecycle.instantiate_encounter_from_trigger
                    → snapshot.encounter.actors  ← MUST contain all combatants

Each test starts from the Playtest 3 shape: the narrator emits
``confrontation="combat"`` with an EMPTY ``npcs_present`` list (the
extraction dropped the adversary), but ``snapshot.npcs`` already has the
opponent recorded at the player's current location from prior turns
(Wave 2A pool/state split — the legacy ``npc_registry`` is gone as of
story 45-52). The handshake must register that opponent as an
EncounterActor.

References:
- AC1: handshake registers every combatant (player + each active NPC)
- AC2: per-actor damage + per-side momentum tracking actually works
- AC3: encounter init emits OTEL span carrying actor_count + combatant_names
- AC4: regression — Crawling Scavenger / Orin / 6 rounds of combat
- AC5: no orphan actor mutation sites in production code

Storage convention: tests load the frozen ``test_genre`` fixture pack
directly from disk via ``load_genre_pack`` to bypass the session-wide
GenreLoader cache (see test_encounter_apply_narration.py for the rationale).
