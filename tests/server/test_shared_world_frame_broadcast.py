"""Pingpong 2026-04-30 follow-on bug: dispatch-winner stuck after merged narration.

Repro: 4P MP, the LAST submitter's WS connection cycles during the long
(30-60s) Claude narration await. The dispatcher's pre-await `socket_id` is
captured in the merged-dispatch closure; the peer-only broadcast added in
4b90250 used `exclude_socket_id=self._socket_id` to skip the dispatcher
"because they receive it through the original outbound queue." But:
- The dispatcher's writer task is cancelled when their pre-await socket
  disconnects, so messages put on `outbound` are silently dropped.
- The post-broadcast envelopes (NARRATION_END / CHAPTER_MARKER / PARTY_STATUS
  / AUDIO_CUE) are NOT in the EventLog, so reconnect replay can't backfill
  them. Last-submitter froze on the prior turn's "Waiting on…" banner with
  disabled input until they hard-reloaded.

Fix: emit shared-world frames via a single broadcast to every CURRENT
socket in the room (`exclude_socket_id=None`). Single delivery path —
peers and dispatcher both receive the frame on whatever socket is
currently registered. Eliminates the double-delivery hazard the prior
peer-only-plus-outbound pattern would have introduced if we'd switched
to broadcast-to-all without removing `outbound.append`.

This is a wiring test — drives the actual `_execute_narration_turn`
handler against a real `SessionRoom` with four connected sockets and
asserts EVERY socket's outbound queue receives the four shared-world
frames after a merged dispatch.

    Pre-fix (4b90250): peer-only broadcast excluded `self._socket_id`,
    relying on `outbound.append` to deliver to the dispatcher. When the
    dispatcher's WS cycled mid-narration the outbound delivery silently
    failed; the four envelopes aren't in EventLog, so reconnect replay
    couldn't backfill them — last-submitter stuck.

    delivers to every CURRENT socket in the room, so the dispatcher's
    queue (or their reconnected queue) gets the frame regardless of
    socket lifecycle.
