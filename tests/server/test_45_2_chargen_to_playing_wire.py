"""Wire-first test for Story 45-2: chargen → PLAYING transition through
the production `_chargen_confirmation()` seam.

The CLAUDE.md "Verify Wiring" principle: tests-pass-but-nothing-is-wired
is a known failure mode. The original 45-2 test suite asserted the
state-machine API correctly (LobbyState, transition_to_playing, etc.) and
the barrier predicate correctly (playing_player_count drives the barrier),
but had a gap: NO test exercised the actual chargen-success path that
calls `room.transition_to_playing(player_id)` at session_handler.py:2999.
If Dev had simply omitted that line, the conftest fixture's auto-promote
would still run, all unit tests would still pass, but the production
seam would silently never fire — peers who completed chargen would stay
in CHARGEN forever and the barrier would never count them.

This test closes that gap. It walks the slug-connect chargen flow in MP
context with `caverns_and_claudes` content, sends a real CONFIRMATION
message through `handle_message`, and asserts the seat is PLAYING after
`_chargen_confirmation()` returns.

If session_handler.py:2999 is removed, this test fails.

    Flow:
      1. Seed an empty MP save (no character yet → handler enters Creating).
      2. Attach room context + WebSocket fixtures.
      3. SESSION_EVENT.connect with game_slug → handler binds room, enters
         _State.Creating, builder constructed.

         returning-player-promotion path at session_handler.py:1148 does
         NOT fire (handler is Creating, not Playing).

         `self._state = _State.Playing` → `self._room.transition_to_playing(player_id)`.
