"""Wiring test: _apply_narration_result_to_snapshot fires scene-end through Session.

Branch map (from inspection of narration_apply.py 1135-1450):

- The line-1443 branch lives inside the legacy beat-application path, gated
  by ``if _legacy_beat_path:`` (set True at 1298 when sealed-letter does not
  apply and the encounter is non-resolved with at least one surviving beat
  selection). Outer scope:

      if enc is not None and not enc.resolved and gated_selections:   # 1162
          ...
          if cdef.resolution_mode == ResolutionMode.sealed_letter_lookup:
              ... _legacy_beat_path = False
          else:
              _legacy_beat_path = True

      if _legacy_beat_path:                                           # 1303
          turn_num = snapshot.turn_manager.interaction                # 1348
          for sel in selections:                                      # 1349
              ...
              result_apply = apply_beat(enc, actor, beat, tier,
                                        turn=turn_num)                # 1363
              ...
              if result_apply.resolved:                               # 1415
                  ... encounter_resolved span / state_transition ...
                  # Scratch sweep + (post-fix) clock advance
                  room.session.end_scene("scene_end", turn=turn_num)  # 1443
                  break

- ``result`` fields read by the gating branch:
  * result.beat_selections              (1148)
  * each sel.actor / sel.beat_id / sel.outcome (BeatSelection objects)

- ``snapshot.encounter`` fields the gating branch requires:
  * encounter is non-None and not resolved (1162)
  * encounter_type matches a confrontation in pack.rules.confrontations (1163)
  * actor named in the selection exists on the encounter (1350)

- ``turn_num`` is bound at line 1348 from
  ``snapshot.turn_manager.interaction`` and threaded through ``apply_beat``
  and the post-resolution sweep.

To drive the resolution path, we use the synthetic two-dial pack's
"attack" beat (kind=strike, base=2) on an opponent-side actor against an
``opponent_metric`` with threshold=2 — one Success-tier strike pushes
opponent_metric to threshold and ``apply_beat`` flips
``enc.resolved = True``, returning ``ApplyResult(resolved=True)``.
