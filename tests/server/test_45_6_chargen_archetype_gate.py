"""Wire-first boundary tests for Story 45-6: chargen archetype-resolution gate.

Playtest 3 (2026-04-19, evropi) shipped a character (``pumblestone_sweedlewit``)
with ``resolved_archetype=NULL``: the snapshot looked valid, the persist
span fired, the state flipped to ``Playing`` — but the narrator had no
archetype anchor, character voice drifted, and the GM panel showed a
class with no archetype to back it.

Three silent-skip branches in
``WebSocketSessionHandler._resolve_character_archetype``
(``websocket_session_handler.py:548-630``) let chargen complete without
binding an archetype:

1. Builder produced no axis pair (``raw is None or "/" not in raw``).
2. Pack lacks ``base_archetypes`` / ``archetype_constraints``.
3. Resolver raised ``GenreValidationError`` (caught and swallowed).

Story 45-6 wires a gate at the chargen-confirmation seam (after
``_resolve_character_archetype``, before ``apply_starting_loadout``)
that distinguishes:

- ``OK_RESOLVED`` — pass (resolver wrote a display name).
- ``OK_NO_AXES`` — pass (pack opted out of the archetype system).
- ``BLOCKED_PARTIAL`` — fail with a typed ERROR frame
  ``code="chargen_archetype_unresolved"``.

Two OTEL spans wrap the gate so Sebastien's GM panel sees every
chargen-confirm decision:

- ``chargen.archetype_gate_evaluated`` — fires on every confirm with a
  ``state`` attribute (``"ok_resolved"`` | ``"ok_no_axes"`` |
  ``"blocked_partial"``).
- ``chargen.archetype_gate_blocked`` — fires only on the blocked branch
  with a ``block_reason`` attribute (``"raw_pair_unresolved"`` |
  ``"missing_axes_with_pack_axes"`` | ``"resolver_raised"``).

Wire-first discipline: tests drive the WS dispatch layer
(``handler.handle_message(CharacterCreationMessage(phase="confirmation"))``)
end-to-end. The gate must be reachable from the production seam, not a
unit-tested helper bolted on the side.

Boundary contract: a regression that removes the gate, the error code,
or either span will trip at least one of these tests.

# Robustness: gate discriminator survives a "/" in resolved display name
#
# Reviewer flagged that the gate's discriminator (`"/"` in
# ``character.resolved_archetype``) is brittle — ``ArchetypeResolved.name``
# is a free-form ``str`` with no validator forbidding "/". A funnel could
# legitimately define a name like "Sage/Healer" today, and the gate would
# misclassify the success as ``resolver_raised``. Reviewer recommended
# switching the discriminator to ``character.archetype_provenance is not
# None`` (set in lockstep by ``apply_archetype_resolved``), which is a
# more durable signal.
#
# This test simulates a name with "/" and asserts the gate correctly
# routes to OK_RESOLVED. With the current shape-based discriminator the
# test fails; with Dev's fix using ``archetype_provenance`` it passes.
