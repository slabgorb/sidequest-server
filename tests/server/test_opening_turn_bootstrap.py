"""Opening-turn bootstrap integration — Story 2.3 Slice H.

Drives chargen confirmation against caverns_and_claudes/grimvault and
asserts the combined response after commit:

- ``CHARACTER_CREATION{phase=complete}`` — the commit frame (Slice D-G)
- ``PARTY_STATUS`` with a populated :class:`CharacterSheetDetails`
  (race / stats / abilities / personality) so the client Character
  tab lands populated at session-start
- ``NARRATION`` + ``NARRATION_END`` — the opening turn fired through
  the orchestrator using ``opening_seed`` and ``opening_directive``
  resolved at connect (Slice B)

Additionally verifies ``opening_directive`` makes it into the
narrator prompt (Early zone), and both the seed + directive are
zeroed on ``_SessionData`` after consumption so subsequent
PLAYER_ACTION turns run directive-free.
