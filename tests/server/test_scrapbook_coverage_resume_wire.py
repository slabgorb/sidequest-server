"""Wire tests for scrapbook coverage detection on save resume (Story 45-10).

The unit tests in ``test_scrapbook_coverage.py`` pin the helper's behavior
in isolation. This file pins the *wiring* — that the helper is actually
invoked from production resume paths. AC4 is explicit: "Both resume
paths (slug + legacy) wire the detector. A half-wired fix that only
patches the slug path leaves the legacy path silent — the test catches
it."

Resume path inventory (post-decomposition, 2026-04-28):

1. **Slug-keyed resume** — ``handlers/connect.py:226`` (``store.load()``),
   line 259 (``if saved is not None:``). Triggered when client provides
   a ``slug`` field (MP rooms or ADR-037 slug-keyed solo).

2. **Legacy non-slug resume** — ``handlers/connect.py:856`` (``store.load()``),
   line 888 (``if saved is not None:``). Triggered by genre/world/player
   triple without a slug — the path Felix's solo sessions still hit.

The context document (sprint/context/context-story-45-10.md) referenced
session_handler.py:1610 / 2138 — those line numbers were pre-decomposition.
The two paths are still distinct, just relocated into ``handlers/connect.py``.
TEA logs this as a no-impact location update — both paths still need wiring.

Test strategy: lightweight static-source checks + import-graph checks.
A full-stack drive-the-WS-handler test would re-invent
``test_chargen_persist_and_play.py``'s setup at 5x the cost; the static
checks are sharp enough to catch the half-fix regression AC4 names.
