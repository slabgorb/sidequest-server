"""Ungraceful client-drop teardown in ``ws_endpoint``.

Playtest 2026-05-17 [BS-BUG-LOW] (firehose-reframed): a routine
ungraceful client disconnect surfaced as ``ws.unexpected_error`` + a
full ``RuntimeError`` traceback at **~1712×** in the live log, burying
every genuine ``ws.unexpected_error`` behind expected-event noise.

Root cause: ``ws_endpoint`` already catches ``WebSocketDisconnect``
(the graceful close path), but when the peer drops *ungracefully* and a
concurrent writer ``send`` has already advanced ``application_state``
past ``CONNECTED``, the reader loop's next ``websocket.receive_text()``
hits Starlette's top-of-function not-connected guard and raises a bare
``RuntimeError('WebSocket is not connected. Need to call "accept"
first.')``. That fell through to the generic ``except Exception``
catch-all → ``logger.exception("ws.unexpected_error")``.

Contract: an ungraceful drop is an *expected* teardown — log INFO, run
the same cleanup as ``WebSocketDisconnect``, emit no error frame, no
traceback. A ``RuntimeError`` raised while the socket is still
``CONNECTED`` is a genuine fault and MUST still surface loudly
(No Silent Fallbacks — the discriminator is the socket state Starlette
itself checks, never the exception message string).
