"""Wiring test — 3-PC MP session per-recipient POV emission (Story 49-8).

End-to-end proof that the new narration projection lands at the wire:

  - Carl's outbound queue receives "You plant a boot..." (2nd-person)
    because he is the anchor of his own action card.
  - Donut's queue receives "Carl plants a boot..." (3rd-person)
    unchanged for that same card.
  - Katia's queue receives "Carl plants a boot..." (3rd-person)
    unchanged for that same card.
  - All three players receive all three cards (no perception filtering
    in this story — that is ADR-028 follow-up).

This test exercises ``emit_event`` via ``WebSocketSessionHandler._emit_event``
just like ``test_perception_rewriter_wiring.py`` — pure dict payloads with
a fake message class so we can read the dict that landed on each queue.

RED until:
  (1) ``sidequest.server.visibility_classifier.classify_narration_visibility``
      exists,
  (2) ``sidequest.agents.pov_swap.swap_to_second_person`` exists,
  (3) the emit pipeline routes NARRATION through both — first to stamp
      the sidecar, then to swap text per-recipient at fan-out.

The sentinel here is the wire-level text on each player's queue. If a
recipient whose ``player_id_to_character[pid] == anchor_pc`` does NOT
see 2nd-person prose, the wiring is broken.
