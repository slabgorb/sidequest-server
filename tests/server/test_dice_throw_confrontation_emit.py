"""Wire-first boundary test: DICE_THROW must emit CONFRONTATION post-beat-apply.

Story 45-3 — Momentum readout state sync.

The bug: between the player's beat-click → DICE_RESULT and the narrator's
NARRATION_END (5–15s on a long turn), the server holds the new
``encounter.player_metric.current`` but never broadcasts it. The UI
``ConfrontationOverlay`` sits on the prior turn's ``confrontationData``
and the dual-dial visibly lags the engine state — Sebastien's lie-detector
flag from playtest 2026-04-19.

The fix: ``dispatch_dice_throw`` (or the caller) must broadcast a
CONFRONTATION frame carrying post-``apply_beat`` momentum on every
non-deferred beat, BEFORE the inline narrator runs. This test exercises
the full ``_handle_dice_throw`` path (handler → dispatch_dice_throw →
inline narrator), captures the room's broadcast queue, and asserts:

1. **AC1 (mid-turn emit):** A CONFRONTATION message is broadcast between
   DICE_RESULT and NARRATION_END, with ``player_metric.current`` /
   ``opponent_metric.current`` reflecting the post-beat-apply encounter
   state.

2. **AC1 negative (opposed-check deferral):** When the active
   confrontation declares ``resolution_mode: opposed_check``, deltas are
   deferred to ``narration_apply``; the dispatcher MUST NOT emit a
   mid-turn CONFRONTATION on this branch.

3. **Existing post-narration emit unchanged (AC5 regression):** the
   post-narration CONFRONTATION emit at ``session_handler.py`` still
   fires once per narration turn — the new mid-turn emit is additive.

Wire-first gate: the test drives the production handler through
``handle_message(DiceThrowMessage)`` — not ``dispatch_dice_throw``
in isolation. A future regression that re-orders emit vs broadcast (or
moves the call inside the narrator) will be caught here.
