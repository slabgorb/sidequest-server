"""Pingpong 2026-04-30: confrontation panel sticks open after the party
physically leaves the encounter location.

Repro: 4P MP, space_opera/coyote_star, turn 8. The narrator activated a
"Diplomatic Negotiation" with Inspector Karenina + a junior clerk on
turn 6. The party then turns extraction-mode and walks out of Karenina's
office over turns 7-8. Location updates correctly through three rooms
(Karenina's Office → Third-Floor Corridor → East Freight Stair). The
Confrontation tab in the side panel still shows the active negotiation
with Karenina + clerk and the four beat buttons clickable, even though
Karenina is two floors up and out of the room. Mechanically problematic:
clicking "Threaten Karenina" would generate puppet narration of an
interaction that can't physically happen.

Fix: ``_apply_narration_result_to_snapshot`` resolves any active
encounter as ``abandoned_on_location_change`` whenever ``result.location``
changes from the prior location. The dispatch branch in
``websocket_session_handler.py`` (``elif prior_live and not now_live:``)
detects the resolved=True flip and broadcasts a CONFRONTATION
{ active: false } clear payload to every connected socket via the
existing handshake path — no new wire message needed.

Adds OTEL ``confrontation_deactivated_on_location_change`` watcher event
keyed on encounter_type + old/new location so the GM panel can verify
the engine fired (CLAUDE.md OTEL principle: silent regressions of this
exact bug must be Sebastien-visible).
