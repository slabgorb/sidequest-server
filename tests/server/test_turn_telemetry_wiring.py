"""Mandatory wiring test: a real production turn (through connect.py's
bind_event_store, not a hand-bound store) actually writes turn_telemetry
rows. Proves the sink is reached from the live turn path, not just
importable.

Harness (from test_event_log_wiring.py):
- _seed_with_character: seed a MULTIPLAYER game with alice's character
- WebSocketSessionHandler + attach_room_context + handle_message for connect
- handle_message for PLAYER_ACTION

C2 join-path exercise: after alice connects, a second player (bob) is
added to the room as a connected observer (not seated, so playing_player_count
stays 1 — barrier fires on alice's single submission). The fake narration
result carries a SubsystemDispatch in secret_routes, so the session handler
emits a SECRET_NOTE event. SECRET_NOTE is VISIBILITY_GATED, so
_publish_secret_routed fires from within the emitters.py `with conn:` C2
block (while conn.in_transaction is True), writing a turn_telemetry row
with a non-NULL event_seq.

    The SubsystemDispatch causes the session handler to emit a SECRET_NOTE
    event (a VISIBILITY_GATED kind). When that event is routed through
    emitters.emit_event, the C2 transaction is open and _project_frames
    runs for the connected bob. CoreInvariantStage hits the VISIBILITY_GATED
    branch and calls _publish_secret_routed, which calls publish_event
    with conn.in_transaction == True — writing a turn_telemetry row with
    a non-NULL event_seq.

    The ``visible_to=["alice"]`` value is deliberately a non-empty player-id
    list (NOT ``"all"``, NOT ``[]``) so CoreInvariantStage routes bob through
    the VISIBILITY_GATED decision with ``malformed=False`` — the documented
    happy-path mechanism.

    NOTE (silent-rot guard): the mechanism depends on SecretNotePayload's
    ``visibility_sidecar`` field serializing to the ``"_visibility"`` wire
    key that CoreInvariantStage reads. If that wire alias is ever renamed,
    this turn would route via CoreInvariantStage's *malformed-fail-close*
    sub-branch instead. That sub-branch STILL calls _publish_secret_routed
    inside the C2 transaction, so both assertions would still pass — but the
    documented happy-path mechanism would no longer match reality. Any such
    rename MUST be manually cross-checked against this test, because the
    assertions alone will not catch the divergence.
