"""Regression tests for playtest 2026-04-30 — Confrontation UI/server
state desync.

Pre-fix flow (the bug Sage hit, post-Crit-Success-Threaten):

1. Player clicks an action button while the UI thinks the encounter is
   active (because the React store still has the prior CONFRONTATION
   payload with ``active=True``).
2. Server has resolved or lost the encounter — could be:
    a. Natural beat-driven resolution where the prior_live → now_live
       emit at session_handler.py was missed (defense-in-depth path).
    b. uvicorn ``--reload`` mid-session that wiped in-memory encounter
       state while the React store kept the action menu.
    c. Any future state-machine path that resolves the encounter
       without emitting a clear.
3. ``DICE_THROW`` arrives with a beat_id; ``dispatch_dice_throw`` rejects
   with ``DiceDispatchError("DICE_THROW with beat_id requires an active
   encounter")``.
4. Pre-fix: handler returned ``[error_msg]`` only — UI showed the red
   error banner but kept the action menu. Every subsequent click
   bounced. Player perceived a totally stuck encounter overlay.

Fix: on this specific rejection, ALSO emit a CONFRONTATION-clear
payload so the overlay unmounts. The error message still flows so the
player sees the rejection and the GM panel sees the span, but the UI
doesn't get stuck in a state where every click bounces.

Scope note: this is a defense-in-depth recovery for cases where the
encounter is *resolved* but the UI didn't get the clear. The
encounter-is-None case (uvicorn reload wiped server state) is a
separate fix — the encounter_type isn't available so a typed clear
can't be built. Tracking under the uvicorn reload zombie bug.
