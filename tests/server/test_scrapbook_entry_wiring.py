"""Wiring test for SCRAPBOOK_ENTRY emission (pingpong 2026-04-26 [S3-REGRESSION]).

The UI's ImageBusProvider has been wired to consume SCRAPBOOK_ENTRY for two
stories, but the server never emitted any. This test drives a real turn
through the orchestrator and asserts:

1. A row lands in the ``scrapbook_entries`` table.
2. A SCRAPBOOK_ENTRY event is appended to the journal.
3. A reconnecting client receives the prior SCRAPBOOK_ENTRY frame during
   replay (closes the loop on the gallery use-case).

Mocked at ``Orchestrator.run_narration_turn`` exactly like
``test_event_log_wiring.py`` — same fake-narration pattern, same in-memory
DB. No FastAPI, no daemon, no LLM calls.
