"""Regression test: every event kind that flows into the events table either
round-trips through ``_build_message_for_kind`` or is on the explicit
``_REPLAY_SKIP_KINDS`` skip list.

Pingpong 2026-04-26 [S3-BUG]: ``_build_message_for_kind`` raised on
``ENCOUNTER_STARTED`` because the watcher_hub side-channel persists encounter
telemetry rows to ``events`` but the replay walker only knew about kinds that
flow through ``_emit_event``. The crash aborted the entire reconnect, leaving
the client stuck on ``Reconnecting…``.

This file is the load-bearing regression-prevention for that whole class of
bug. Two tests:

1. ``test_kind_to_message_cls_includes_known_live_emit_kinds`` — every kind
   that ``_emit_event`` could be called with today is registered with a
   message class.
2. ``test_replay_handles_every_persisted_kind`` — every kind that producers
   write to the events table either rebuilds successfully via
   ``_build_message_for_kind`` (when registered) or is explicitly skipped via
   ``_REPLAY_SKIP_KINDS`` (when journal-only telemetry).
3. ``test_reconnect_skips_encounter_kinds_without_crash`` — the actual
   "broken save" reconnect path: an events table containing
   ``ENCOUNTER_STARTED`` rows must not crash the replay walker.
