"""Story 45-21 / 45-52 — Npc.core.edge populated from combat stats at handshake.

Playtest 3 (Orin save, 2026-04-19): the Crawling Scavenger sat in the
legacy ``snapshot.npc_registry`` with ``hp=0`` / ``max_hp=0``. Any
HP-check subsystem that queried the registry to determine creature
liveness saw "already dead" and skipped — six rounds of combat, opponent
dead from turn 0 according to the registry.

Root cause: nothing wrote combat stats into the registry entry. The
encounter handshake knew the actors and the per-side dial threshold
(= effective pool size), but did not propagate that into the registry.

Story 45-52 cleanup rewires the publish seam: the legacy ``npc_registry``
is gone; the canonical home for runtime creature pools is
``Npc.core.edge`` (ADR-078, ADR-014). At encounter start the handshake
calls ``_publish_combat_edge_to_npcs``, which writes
``current``/``max`` onto each opponent-side ``Npc.core.edge`` and emits
``npc.edge_published`` OTEL spans so the GM panel lie-detector can
verify the seam fired.

References:
- AC1: current/max written when combat stats are emitted
- AC2: pool cannot report current==0 unless the NPC is actually defeated
- AC3: OTEL span emitted with current/max values
- AC4: no regression on existing combat stats flow
- Wiring AC: production encounter init path actually calls the helper
