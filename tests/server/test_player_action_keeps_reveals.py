"""Barrier-fire dispatch must NOT wipe sealed peer reveals.

Playtest 2026-05-17 (Keith): "leave the current player turns visible
after they seal their turns." The dispatch-time
``_broadcast_cleared_to_party(reason="dispatch")`` blanked every reveal
row the instant the last player sealed — so the whole table went empty
through the entire narrator-thinking gap. The clear now moves to the
turn boundary (client flushes on NARRATION_END); the disconnect-path
clear is unaffected.

This wiring test pins the new contract: driving the 2-player barrier to
fire produces NO ACTION_REVEAL CLEARED. (The speaking-PC PLAYER_SPEECH
from the 2026-05-17 dialogue fix must still fire.)
