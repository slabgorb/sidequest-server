"""End-to-end ProjectionFilter wiring test.

Asserts the single-truth invariant in executable form:
    - 2 players + 1 GM receive projections consistent with the rules
    - projection_cache has exactly N rows per event
    - projection.filter.decide span count equals the projection count
    - Reconnecting a player receives byte-identical frames to the live
      session (via cache read, no re-filter)
    - GM canonical view is untouched by any rule
