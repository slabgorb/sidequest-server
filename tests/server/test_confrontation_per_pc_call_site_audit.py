"""Call-site audit — all 5 build_confrontation_payload sites must project per-PC.

Story 49-7 RED. The story body lists exactly the dispatch sites that
broadcast a CONFRONTATION today and warns:

    All five build sites must move to per-recipient (audit with grep
    before declaring done — ``build_confrontation_payload\\|
    build_clear_confrontation_payload``).

This is the audit test. For each of the five production sites, we
ast-parse the source file and confirm that every
``build_confrontation_payload(...)`` call (other than the definition
itself) is either:

  a. Inside a ``for ... in ... connected_player_ids(...)`` loop with the
     per-recipient class/slots/prepared context resolved, OR
  b. Passes a ``recipient_pc=`` keyword argument directly (the
     single-recipient sites like slug-resume and yield).

The asymmetric ``build_clear_confrontation_payload`` (empty beats) is
intentionally NOT audited — story note in the session:
``build_clear_confrontation_payload is empty-beats already — keep
single broadcast for clear since there is nothing to per-PC project.``

If a new call site is added in the future and forgotten here, the test
will still fail when the audit's enumerated path list goes stale —
catching the regression Sebastien's GM panel would otherwise miss.

This is the wiring test the per-pc projection suite needs per CLAUDE.md
('Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test' / 'Verify Wiring, Not Just
Existence').
