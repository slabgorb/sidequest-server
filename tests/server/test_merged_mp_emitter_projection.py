"""ADR-105 Track A — merged-MP emitter must not be perception-bypassed.

The MP fan-out (`sidequest/server/emitters.py:emit_event`) excludes the
*emitter* (`handler._session_data.player_id`) from per-recipient
projection — they receive the raw Invariant-3 frame. That is correct in
**solo** (the single player is the sole author) but catastrophic in
**merged-MP dispatch**: the driving handler is whichever player submitted
last, NOT the sole author of a shared narration covering every seated PC.
The driver is then the one player who never gets a
`projection.filter.decide` (×0 spans) and receives the unfiltered shared
blob — the confirmed 2026-05-16 caverns_sunden information-firewall
breach (ADR-105).

Track A makes the call site thread an explicit ``author_player_id``. When
set, the driver is projected like any other recipient (one
`projection.filter.decide` per DISTINCT connected player, swap target ==
that recipient). When ``None`` (solo / legacy callers), the deliberate
emitter-bypass + lazy_fill-on-reconnect invariant is preserved
byte-identical (guarded by
``test_projection_end_to_end_wiring.test_emitter_reconnect_relies_on_lazy_fill``).

Content redaction of the shared blob is explicitly Track B — this test
asserts *binding* (one projection pass per distinct recipient incl. the
driver), not content.
