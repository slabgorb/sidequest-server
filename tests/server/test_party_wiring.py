"""Integration: end-to-end party wiring test — drop → pause → reconnect → resume (MP-02 Task 9).

Verifies the complete flow:
1. Alice seats + connects.
2. Bob seats + connects.
3. Bob disconnects → alice sees PLAYER_PRESENCE{disconnected} then GAME_PAUSED.
4. Bob reconnects → alice sees PLAYER_PRESENCE{connected} then GAME_RESUMED.

Uses caverns_and_claudes / grimvault (genre/world available in the content repo).
