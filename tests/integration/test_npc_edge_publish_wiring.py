"""End-to-end wiring for the story 45-52 NPC subsystem cleanup.

Three Reviewer asks from 45-47 surface as live OTEL signals here — each
test exercises the production wire and asserts the typed
``state_transition`` (or relevant attribute) reaches the GM panel
through the routing pipeline. Per CLAUDE.md "Verify Wiring, Not Just
Existence": this file is the dedicated wiring guard the story's "add
dedicated wiring test" AC calls for.

Covered seams:

1. ``SPAN_NPC_EDGE_PUBLISHED`` — fires at encounter handshake when the
   dial-derived edge pool is written onto ``Npc.core.edge``. Replaces
   the pre-Wave-2A ``npc_registry.hp_set`` seam.

2. ``location_available`` attribute on
   ``encounter.no_opponent_available`` — discriminates "the player had
   no resolved location" from "no NPCs at this location" (both shapes
   silently produced an empty fallback pre-fix; only the latter is a
   legitimate empty-scene).

3. ``s2_malformed_npcs_skipped`` / ``s2_nameless_entries_dropped``
   attributes on the ``snapshot.canonicalize`` span — silent-skip
   counters on the legacy-save migration so corrupt registry entries
   are visible on the GM panel rather than eaten on the floor.

These three OTEL channels are the lie-detector contract for the Wave-2A
cleanup: if any silently fails, Sebastien's GM panel goes dark on the
exact seams the cleanup touched.
