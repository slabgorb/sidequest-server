"""Story 2026-05-10 — full end-to-end wiring for class mechanical surface.

Mandatory wiring test per CLAUDE.md "Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test".

Drives a real Cleric chargen against the actual caverns_and_claudes genre
pack content and asserts the full AbilityDefinition + class_moves contract
holds end-to-end through the protocol shape that the WS state-mirror sends.

Chain exercised:
    classes.yaml
    → genre loader (load_genre_pack)
    → CharacterBuilder._seed_class_abilities (builder.build())
    → Character.abilities
    → party_member_from_character (views.py)
    → CharacterSheetDetails.abilities + class_moves

If _seed_class_abilities is broken, or the views wiring for class_moves is
missing, or classes.yaml lacks the Cleric abilities block — this test fails.
