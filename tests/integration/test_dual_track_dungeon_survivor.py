"""Regression: 2026-04-25-dungeon_survivor — Sam KO'd, engine had said
'player_victory'. Under dual-track momentum the same beat sequence must
resolve to opponent_victory.

This is the lie-detector check from CLAUDE.md's OTEL Observability
Principle: prose says one thing, engine says another, GM panel reconciles.

Reference save narrative_log (rows 6-7) shows Sam stumbling and being KO'd
by the Promo. The pre-fix engine collapsed opponent beats onto the player
metric, resolving as player_victory. The dual-track engine routes each
actor's beats to their own dial so the Promo's wins accumulate on the
opponent dial until threshold=10 is crossed.

The plan's 4-beat script (CritSuccess, Success, CritSuccess, CritSuccess)
adds 2+2+2+2=8 to the opponent dial — one beat short of threshold=10.
A 5th beat (CritSuccess, matching narrative row 7's "sickle catches Sam
square across the temple") crosses the threshold and resolves the encounter.
