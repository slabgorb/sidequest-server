"""Peer save receives only the filtered event stream.

Canonical save on the narrator-host holds the union; peer save holds the
filtered subset per MP spec 2026-04-22. These tests assert the session
handler's write-split helper is correct.

The helper we test is pure:
  inputs:  event_log (accepts append), filter (project), envelope, players, view
  outputs: (canonical appended once) + (list of sent frames per include=True)
