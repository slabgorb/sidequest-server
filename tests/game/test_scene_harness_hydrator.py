"""Tests for Stories 50-18 and 50-19 — scene-harness fixture hydrator.

Unit tests for ``sidequest.game.scene_harness.hydrate_fixture``: the YAML →
``GameSnapshot`` converter that backs ``POST /dev/scene/{name}`` per ADR-092.

Layout:
* Lines 80-329 — Story 50-18 RED tests (hydrator contract, error mapping,
  yaml.safe_load discipline, path-traversal guard).
* Lines 332+ — Story 50-19 tests (extend ``_hydrate_character()`` to
  hydrate ``Character.known_facts`` from a ``known_facts:`` YAML block).

The 50-18 contract was the original spec for this file; the 50-19 cases
extend it for the known_facts hydration path.

Hydrator contract (extracted from ADR-092 §Hydration rules and the four
canonical fixtures in ``scenarios/fixtures/``):

    from sidequest.game.scene_harness import (
        FixtureNotFoundError,
        FixtureValidationError,
        hydrate_fixture,
    )

    snapshot = hydrate_fixture(name="combat_brawl_wasteland", fixtures_dir=Path(...))

* Returns a ``GameSnapshot`` with ``model_config = {"extra": "ignore"}``.
* Raises ``FixtureNotFoundError`` when ``{fixtures_dir}/{name}.yaml`` is missing.
* Raises ``FixtureValidationError`` on schema violations (missing ``genre``
  / ``world``, malformed ``character``, etc.) — never a bare ``yaml.YAMLError``
  or ``pydantic.ValidationError`` leaking past the module boundary.
* MUST use ``yaml.safe_load`` (lang-review rule #8 — never ``yaml.load`` on
  untrusted-input parsers; the harness is dev-gated, but the rule still binds).
* MUST NOT silently default missing ``genre`` / ``world`` to empty strings
  (CLAUDE.md "No Silent Fallbacks").

# the legacy singular ``character:`` block) and project to
# ``GameSnapshot.characters`` in order. The legacy singular form continues

# ── Story 50-20: scenario_state hydration (ADR-092 follow-on) ───────────────
#
# RED tests for the top-level ``scenario_state:`` block. Hydration projects
# the block into ``GameSnapshot.scenario_state`` (a ``ScenarioState``), which
# holds:
#
#     * clue_graph (ClueGraph — list of ClueNode)
#     * discovered_clues (set[str] of clue ids)
#     * npc_roles (dict[NPC name -> "guilty" | "witness" | "innocent"])
#     * guilty_npc (string — accepted as name or id; persists as the canonical id)
#     * tension (float, clamped to [0.0, 1.0])
#
# Validation rules (ACs 3-9):
#   * ClueGraph nodes must satisfy ``ClueNode`` pydantic shape — missing
#     required fields raise FixtureValidationError (HTTP 422).
#   * ``discovered_clues`` must obey the DAG: a discovered clue with a
#     ``requires`` entry not also in the final ``discovered_clues`` set is
#     invalid. The hydrator validates set-membership against the final
#     declared set — YAML order is irrelevant per the AC2 ``set[str]``
#     typing (Reviewer [HIGH-1] rework, 50-20).
#   * ``npc_roles`` values must be one of ("guilty", "witness", "innocent").
#   * ``guilty_npc`` must resolve to an entry in the fixture's ``npcs``
#     roster (name match OR id match — fixture-author convenience).
#   * ``tension`` is clamped silently to [0.0, 1.0]; out-of-range is NOT a
#     422 (matches ``ScenarioState.set_tension()`` semantics).
#   * Missing ``scenario_state:`` block: ``snapshot.scenario_state`` is
#     None (backwards-compat with the four canonical pre-50-20 fixtures).
#   * Malformed ``scenario_state:`` (e.g. a list at the top, or a typo'd
#     child key) raises FixtureValidationError — no silent skip.

# ── Story 50-20 (rework, Reviewer [HIGH-1]): DAG-order independence ─────────
#
# `discovered_clues` is documented in AC#2 as ``set[str]`` — unordered by
# definition. AC#4's "unmet requires" must be checked against the FINAL
# declared set, not the per-clue replay state. The initial 50-20 impl built
# a ScenarioState with empty discovered_clues and replayed each declared id
# through ``ScenarioState.discover_clue()`` in YAML order, which raises if
# any clue's requires aren't yet in the (intermediate) discovered set.
#
# This rejects valid fixtures where the final set IS DAG-valid but the YAML
# listing isn't topologically sorted. The Reviewer found that
# ``discovered_clues: [clue_b, clue_a]`` (both clues present, clue_b
# requires clue_a) raised with the misleading message
# "missing prerequisites ['clue_a']" — even though clue_a is in the YAML
# immediately below clue_b.
#
# Fix discipline: validate against the final declared set, not the replay
# state. The hydrator should accept any YAML ordering whose final set
# satisfies the DAG, and reject only when a clue's requires are genuinely
# absent from the declared set.

#   1. ``abilities:`` under a ``character:`` block → ``Character.abilities``
#      (``list[AbilityDefinition]`` — sidequest/protocol/models.py:42).
#   2. top-level ``magic_state:`` → ``GameSnapshot.magic_state``
#      (``MagicState`` — sidequest/magic/state.py:123).
#
# Discipline mirrors the scenario_state branch (50-20):
#   * Absent block → snapshot field stays at the pydantic default
#     (``abilities=[]``, ``magic_state=None``) so the four canonical
#     pre-50-22 fixtures keep working unchanged.
#   * Malformed block → ``FixtureValidationError`` (HTTP 422). NEVER a
#     silent skip and NEVER a silent empty default (ADR-014 "magic state
#     is Diamond"; ADR-092 "Failure is loud"; CLAUDE.md "No Silent
#     Fallbacks"; lang-review #1 / #11).
