"""Targeting bias under taunt — real production path through apply_beat.

When an enemy strikes and taunt is active, the taunter absorbs the hit
instead of the default first-listed ally.  These tests drive the REAL
production path:

    apply_beat → _opposite_side_first_actor (taunt-aware) → CreatureCore.apply_edge_delta

Shape A wiring: the bias lives in _opposite_side_first_actor inside
beat_kinds.py — the same helper that apply_beat's focus/swarm branch
already calls.  No indirection through a standalone helper module.

Spec: docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-10-class-mechanical-surface-design.md §8.
