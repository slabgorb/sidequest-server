"""Integration test for sidequest.game.builder — Slice 5.

Wiring test per CLAUDE.md:
    Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test
    Unit tests prove a component works in isolation. That's not enough.
    Every set of tests must include at least one integration test that
    verifies the component is wired into the system — imported, called,
    and reachable from production code paths.

This test loads a real genre pack via load_genre_pack(), constructs a
CharacterBuilder with the pack's actual char_creation scenes and
rules, walks the full scene flow, and builds a real Character. No
fixtures, no stubs, no mock data — if this passes, the builder is
reachable from production content.

One pack (caverns_and_claudes) is enough for the wiring check. The
full cross-pack matrix — each of the 6 genres walked through
representative flows — belongs to Story 2.2's dispatch integration
tests, not 2.1's unit surface.
