"""Beneath Sünden Plan 7 Task 6 — MANDATORY WIRING TEST.

CLAUDE.md "Every Test Suite Needs a Wiring Test": unit tests prove a
component works in isolation; that is not enough. This file proves the
materializer's look-ahead frontier seam is **invoked from the real
production region-transition path** — not called directly by a test.

The real production region-transition point that mutates
``snap.current_region`` mid-session is the ADR-011 ``WorldStatePatch``
apply in ``GameSnapshot.apply_world_patch`` (session.py) — the narrator's
escape-hatch / monster-manual-inject path both flow through it
(``sidequest/agents/tools/apply_world_patch.py``,
``sidequest/server/dispatch/monster_manual_inject.py``). ADR-055's
``room_movement`` runtime surface (``validate_room_transition`` /
``apply_validated_move``) is explicitly deferred to a later story
(``room_movement.py`` docstring) and is ROOM-level, orthogonal to the
REGION-transition the materializer's frontier needs. So the
frontier-approach/crossing hook lands on the real ``apply_world_patch``
region-transition point, extending it + ADR-055 ``region_init``
semantics — NOT a parallel navigation path, NOT a stub.

Task 6 owns the producer side (the real dispatch seam wired into the real
path + promote-to-active recognition). Task 7 owns the async worker that
consumes the enqueue — this test spies the seam, it does not implement
the worker.
