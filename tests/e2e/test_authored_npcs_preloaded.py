"""Wiring: authored NPCs (Kestrel crew + Dura Mendes) are in ``state.npcs``
before the first narrator turn fires. Ensures pre-loading happened on
fresh sessions.

This is the load-bearing wiring test for the canned-openings story —
the unit tests at ``tests/game/test_world_materialization_authored_npcs.py``
prove ``preload_authored_npcs`` works in isolation against synthetic
fixtures; this test proves the function works against the actual
shipping coyote_star content.

See ``docs/superpowers/specs/2026-05-01-canned-openings-design.md`` §7.3.
