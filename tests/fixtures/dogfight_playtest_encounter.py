"""Reusable playtest fixture for the space_opera dogfight engine (T7).

A small helper module that constructs a live, real-content space_opera
dogfight encounter wired through the production dispatch path, and
exposes a clean API for driving turns. Used by integration tests and by
manual playtest drivers.

This is the "smallest viable playtest scaffold" demonstrating the full
T1-T6 dogfight engine working end-to-end:
    - Real content load (sidequest-content/genre_packs/space_opera/)
    - Production instantiation (assigns role=red/blue per T3)
    - Production dispatch (_apply_narration_result_to_snapshot, T5)
    - Sealed-letter resolution (per_actor_state mutation, OTEL spans)

Per CLAUDE.md no-silent-fallbacks:
    - Missing sidequest-content raises FileNotFoundError (callers can
      pytest.skip on it).
    - Invalid maneuvers raise ValueError before dispatch.
    - All other errors propagate from the production code path.

Per CLAUDE.md don't-reinvent: this module distills the fixture-construction
patterns from ``tests/server/dispatch/test_sealed_letter_dispatch_integration.py``
into reusable helpers — no new code paths, just a stable surface around
the existing production wiring.

    """Construct a fresh GameSnapshot with an active space_opera dogfight.

    Loads real content from ``sidequest-content/genre_packs/space_opera/``
    via the production loader, then drives a single instantiation turn
    through ``_apply_narration_result_to_snapshot`` so the encounter is
    built by the same code path the running server uses.

    Args:
        player_pilot_name: Name to assign the red (player) actor.
        opponent_pilot_name: Name to assign the blue (opponent) NPC actor.
        pack_root: Optional override for the genre_packs root (e.g. for
            tests that ship their own content). Defaults to
            ``DEFAULT_CONTENT_ROOT``.

    Returns:
        Tuple of (snapshot, dogfight ConfrontationDef, loaded GenrePack).
        The pack is returned so callers don't have to re-load it to drive
        further turns; the ConfrontationDef is exposed because callers
        commonly want to inspect ``interaction_table.maneuvers_consumed``
        for legal-maneuver validation, beat lists, etc.

    Raises:
        FileNotFoundError: ``sidequest-content`` is not on disk at the
            expected location. Callers in test contexts should
            ``pytest.skip(...)`` on this rather than papering over it.
        ValueError: Loaded space_opera pack lacks a dogfight ConfrontationDef
            (content drift — surface loudly per CLAUDE.md).
        AssertionError: Production instantiation didn't produce the expected
            two-actor red/blue encounter (engine drift — caller wants to know).

    Side effects:
        - Loads space_opera genre pack from disk.
        - Drives one narration turn through the production dispatch path
          to instantiate the encounter (this is what makes per_actor_state
          start at ``{}`` — matching production behavior, not pre-seeded).
