"""Story 47-9 — Force first innate_v1 firing on Coyote Star with GM-panel observability.

The magic subsystem is wired end-to-end but never invoked in play: 1 working_log
entry across 7 saves / 111 turns. Architect audit (2026-05-07) identified the
break at the prompt level — the narrator's CRITICAL MAGIC RULE is reactive
("emit magic_working when prose depicts a working") with no proactive trigger
to depict one. innate_v1 has fired zero times because nothing in the prose flow
stresses a character into reflexive surfacing.

This test file enforces the proactive-prompt contract via three coordinated
assertions, each covering one segment of the path. None of these tests claims
to be "end-to-end" alone — together they triangulate the wiring:

* **AC1 (context_builder unit)**: ``build_magic_context_block`` injects an
  innate_v1 worked example when the plugin is active (sentinel-pinned), and
  omits the block entirely when not.
* **AC2 (prompt assembly + wiring)**: ``Orchestrator.build_narrator_prompt``
  surfaces both the rewritten CRITICAL MAGIC RULE phrases (NARRATOR_OUTPUT_ONLY
  → assembled prompt) and the worked-example sentinel from context_builder.
  Negative test confirms the worked example does NOT leak into a non-innate
  world's prompt.
* **AC3 (content schema + agency)**: ``coyote_star/openings.yaml`` includes
  at least one opening with ``magic_microbleed.cost_bar='sanity'`` and
  PC-anchored reflexive-surfacing detail, AND that detail does NOT narrate
  internal perception (NARRATOR_AGENCY enforcement).
* **AC4 (apply pipeline)**: ``apply_magic_working`` with a worked-example-shape
  dict produces the magic.working watcher span, appends to working_log, and
  debits the sanity bar.
* **AC4 supplement (dispatch seam)**: a raw narrator response string flows
  through ``extract_structured_from_response`` → ``apply_magic_working`` and
  produces the same span + debit. Pins the historic-failure-prone seam.
* **AC7 (persistence regression)**: after apply, the snapshot survives a
  SqliteStore roundtrip with working_log and ledger value preserved.

AC5 is exercised by AC4 / AC4-supplement (working_log length and sanity bar
value below chargen). AC6 (GM dashboard ``just otel`` verification) is a
manual step deferred to Story 47-2 — it cannot be automated without a
running orchestrator + browser.
